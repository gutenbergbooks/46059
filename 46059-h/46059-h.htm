<h2>THE ADOPTING OF ROSA
MARIE</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>Borrowed Babies</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE oldest inhabitant said that Lakeville
was experiencing an unusual fall.
He would probably have said the same thing
if the high-perched town had accidentally
tumbled off the bluff into the blue lake; but
in this instance, he referred merely to the
weather, which was certainly unusually mild
for autumn.</p>

<p>It was not, however, the oldest, but four
of the youngest citizens that rejoiced most
in this unusual prolonging of summer; for
the continued warm weather made it possible
for those devoted friends, Jean Mapes, Marjory
Vale, Mabel Bennett and little Bettie
Tucker, to spend many a delightful hour in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
their precious Dandelion Cottage, the real,
tumble-down house that was now, after so
many narrow escapes, safely their very own.
Some day, to be sure, it would be torn down
to make room for a habitable dwelling, but
that unhappy day was still too remote to
cause any uneasiness.</p>

<p>Of course, when very cold weather should
come, it would be necessary to close the beloved
Cottage, for there was no heating
plant, there were many large cracks over and
under the doors and around the windows;
and by lying very flat on the dining-room
floor and peering under the baseboards, one
could easily see what was happening in the
next yard. These, and other defects, would
surely make the little house uninhabitable in
winter; but while the unexpectedly extended
summer lasted, the Cottagers were rejoicing
over every pleasant moment of weather and
praying hard for other pleasant moments.</p>

<p>Of all the games played in Dandelion Cottage,
the one called "Mother" was the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
popular. To play it, it was necessary, first of
all, to divide the house into four equal parts.
As there were five rooms, this division might
seem to offer no light task; but, by first subtracting
the kitchen, it was possible to solve
this difficult mathematical problem to the
Cottagers' entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>But of course one can't play "Mother"
without possessing a family. The Cottagers
solved this problem also. Bettie's home
could always be counted on to furnish at
least two decidedly genuine babies and Jean
could always borrow a perfectly delightful
little cousin named Anne Halliday; but Marjory
and Mabel, to their sorrow, were absolutely
destitute of infantile relatives. Mabel
was the chief sufferer. Sedate Marjory,
plausible of tongue, convincing in manner,
could easily accumulate a most attractive
family at very short notice by the simple expedient
of borrowing babies from the next
block; but nowhere within reasonable reach
was there a mother willing to intrust her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
precious offspring a second time to heedless
Mabel.</p>

<p>"Now, Mabel," Mrs. Mercer would say,
when Mabel pleaded to have young Percival
for her very own for just one brief hour,
"I'd really like to oblige you, but it's getting
late in the season, you are not careful enough
about doors and windows and the last time
you borrowed Percival you brought him
home with a stiff neck that lasted three
days."</p>

<p>"But I did remember to return him,"
pleaded Mabel.</p>

<p>"Do you sometimes forget?" queried
Mrs. Mercer, with interest.</p>

<p>"I did twice," confessed always honest
Mabel; "but truly I don't see how <i>I</i> can help
it when babies sleep and sleep and sleep the
way those two did. You see, I made a bed
for Gerald Price on the lowest-down closet
shelf, and he was so perfectly comfortable
that he thought he was asleep for all night."</p>

<p>"What about the other time?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was Mollie Dixon. But then, I had
five children that day and only one bed.
Mollie slipped down in the crack at the back&mdash;she's
awfully thin&mdash;and I never missed
her until her mother came after her. That
was rather a bad time [Mabel sighed at the
recollection] for Mrs. Dixon found the Cottage
locked up for the night and poor little
Mollie crying under the bed."</p>

<p>"Mabel! And you want to borrow my
precious Percival!"</p>

<p>"But it couldn't happen <i>again</i>," protested
Mabel, earnestly. "Bettie says that
I'm just like lightning; I never strike twice
in the same place. That's the reason I get
into so many different kinds of scrapes. I'll
be ever so careful, though, if you'll let me
borrow Percival just this one time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mercer, however, refused to part
with Percival. Other mothers, approached
by pleading Mabel, refused likewise to intrust
their babies to her enthusiastic but
heedless keeping. They knew her too well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"The thing for you to do," suggested
Marjory, ostentatiously washing the perfectly
clean faces of the four delightful
small persons that she had been able, without
any trouble at all, to borrow in Blaker Street,
"is to find a mother that really <i>wants</i> to get
rid of her children."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bob Tucker, who had dropped
in to deliver the basket of apples that Mrs.
Crane had sent to her former neighbors,
"you ought to advertise for the kind of
mother that feeds her babies to crocodiles.
Perhaps some of them have emigrated to
this country and sort of miss the Ganges
River."</p>

<p>"You might try the orphan asylum," offered
Jean, as balm for this wound. "It's
only four blocks from here."</p>

<p>"I have," returned Mabel, dejectedly.
"I went there early this morning."</p>

<p>"What happened?" demanded Bettie,
who had just arrived with a little Tucker
under each arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"They said they'd let them go 'permanently
to responsible parties.' I didn't
know just exactly what that meant, so I
said: 'Does that mean that you'll lend me a
few for two hours?'"</p>

<p>"And would they?"</p>

<p>"Well, they didn't. They said I'd better
borrow a Teddy bear."</p>

<p>"How mean," said sympathetic Bettie.
"Nevermind, I'll lend you Peter, this time."</p>

<p>"Say," queried Mabel, after she had accepted
Bettie's proffered brother, "what
does 'permanently' mean?"</p>

<p>"For keeps," explained Jean.</p>

<p>"What are 'responsible parties'?"</p>

<p>"Jean and Bettie and I," twinkled Marjory,
"but not you."</p>

<p>"That's good," laughed Bob, who, like
Marjory, loved to tease. "But never mind,
Mabel. After you've practised a year or
two on Peter, who's a nuisance if there ever
was one, you'll find yourself growing
respons&mdash;&mdash; Whoop! What was that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"That" was a sudden crash that resounded
through the house. Everybody
rushed to the kitchen. The big dish-pan
that Mabel had left on the edge of the
kitchen table was upside down on the floor.
At least half of little Peter Tucker was under
it. But the half that remained outside was
so unmistakably alive that nobody felt very
seriously alarmed&mdash;except Peter.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" said Mabel, removing
the pan, "this is just a little Tucker and
not any Percival Mercer! Cheer up, Peter.
You're not as wet as you think you are.
There wasn't more than a quart of water in
that pan and it was almost perfectly clean."</p>

<p>And Peter, soothed by Mabel's reassuring
tone, immediately cheered up.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>Rosa Marie</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>NOT long after Mabel's ineffectual attempt
to borrow an orphan Mrs.
Bennett dispatched her small daughter to
Lake Street to find out, if possible, why Mrs.
Malony, the poultry woman, had failed to
send the week's supply of fresh eggs.</p>

<p>Now, the way to Mrs. Malony's was most
interesting, particularly to a young person
of observing habits. There were houses on
only one side of the street and most of those
were tumbling down under the weight of
the sand that each rain carried down the
hillside. But the opposite side of the road
was even more attractive, for there one had
a grassy, shrubby bank where one could pick
all sorts of things off bushes and get burrs
in one's stockings; a narrow stretch of
pebbled beach where one could sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
find an agate, and a wide basin of very shallow
water where one could almost&mdash;but not
quite&mdash;step from stone to stone without
wetting one's feet. It was certainly an enjoyable
spot. The distance from Mabel's
home to Mrs. Malony's was very short&mdash;a
matter of perhaps five blocks. But if a body
went the longest way round, stopped to scour
the green bank for belated blackberries,
prickly hazelnuts, dazzling golden-rod or
rare four-leaved clovers; or loitered to
gather a dress-skirtful of stony treasures
from the glittering beach, going to Mrs.
Malony's meant a great deal more than a
five blocks' journey.</p>

<p>Just a little beyond the poultry woman's
house, on the lake side of the straggling
street, a small, but decidedly attractive point
of land jutted waterward for perhaps two
hundred feet. On this projecting point
stood a small shanty or shack, built, as Mabel
described it later, mostly of knot-holes. She
meant, without knowing how to say it, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the lumber in the hut was of the poorest
possible quality.</p>

<p>On this long-to-be-remembered day, a
small object moving in the clearing that surrounded
the shack attracted Mabel's attention.
Curiosity led her closer to investigate.</p>

<p>"It's just as I thought!" exclaimed
Mabel, peering rapturously through the
bushes. "It's a real baby!"</p>

<p>Sure enough! It <i>was</i> a baby.</p>

<p>Mabel edged closer, moving cautiously for
fear of frightening her unexpected find.
She saw a small toddler, aged somewhere
between two and three years, roving aimlessly
about the chip-strewn clearing. The
child's round cheeks, chubby wrists, bare feet
and sturdy legs were richly brown. A
straggling fringe of jet-black hair overhung
the stout baby's black, beadlike eyes.</p>

<p>Near the doorway of the rickety shack a
man, half French, half Indian, stood talking
earnestly and with many gesticulations to
a dark-skinned woman, framed by the doorway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
The woman had large black eyes,
shaded by very long black lashes. She wore
her rather coarse black hair in two long,
thick braids that hung in front of her straight
shoulders. In spite of her dark color, her
worn shoes, her ragged, untidy gown, she
seemed to Mabel an exceedingly pretty
woman. The man, too, was handsome, after
a bold, picturesque fashion; but the woman
was the more pleasing.</p>

<p>Mabel approached timidly. She felt that
she was intruding.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said she, ingratiatingly.
"Is this your little boy?"</p>

<p>"Him girl," returned the woman, with a
sudden flash of white teeth between parted
crimson lips. "Name Rosa Marie. Yes,
him <i>ma petite</i> daughtaire. You like the
looks on him, hey?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so much," cried Mabel, impulsively.
"Oh, <i>would</i> you do me a favor?"</p>

<p>"A favaire," repeated the woman, with a
puzzled glance. "W'at ees a favaire?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, <i>would</i> you lend your baby to me?
Would you let me have her to play with
for&mdash;&mdash; Oh, for all day?"</p>

<p>"Here?" queried the mother, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"No, not here. In my own home&mdash;up
there, on the hill. <i>Could</i> I keep her until
six o'clock? I just adore babies, and she's
so fat and cunning! Oh, please, <i>please</i>!
I'd be just awfully obliged."</p>

<p>A look of understanding flashed suddenly
between the man and the woman; but Mabel,
stooping to make friends with little Rosa
Marie, did not observe it.</p>

<p>"Your fodder 'ave nice house, plainty
food, plainty money?" queried the woman,
running a speculative eye over Mabel's plain
but substantial wardrobe.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," returned Mabel, thoughtlessly.
"And besides I have a playhouse. That is,
it isn't exactly mine, but I just about live in
it with three other girls, and that's where I
want to take Rosa Marie. I'll be awfully
careful of her if you'll only let me take her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Oh, <i>do</i> you think she'll come with me?
Couldn't you <i>tell</i> her to?"</p>

<p>The woman, bending to look into Rosa
Marie's black eyes, talked loudly and rapidly
in some foreign tongue. The mother's voice
was harsh, but her eyes, Mabel noticed,
seemed soft and tender, and much more
beautiful than Rosa Marie's.</p>

<p>"Now," said the woman, turning to
Mabel and speaking in broken English, "eef
you want her, you must go at once. Go now,
I tell you. Go queek, queek! Pull hard eef
she ees drag behind. But go, I tell
you, <i>go</i>!"</p>

<p>The voice rose to an unpleasant, almost
too stirring pitch that jarred suddenly on
Mabel's nerves; but, obeying these hasty instructions,
the little girl drew Rosa Marie
out of the inclosure, led her across the street
and lifted her to the sidewalk. Looking
back from the slight elevation, Mabel
noticed that the man was again talking
earnestly and gesticulating excitedly; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the woman, once more framed by the doorway,
followed, with her big black eyes, the
chubby figure of Rosa Marie.</p>

<p>"I'll bring her back all safe and sound,"
shouted Mabel, over her shoulder. "Don't
be afraid. Good-by, until six o'clock!"</p>

<p>Escorting Rosa Marie to Dandelion Cottage
proved no light task. Her legs were
very short, it soon became evident that she
was not accustomed to using them for walking
purposes, the way was mostly uphill
and the little brown feet were bare. At first
Mabel led, coaxed and encouraged with the
utmost patience; but presently Rosa Marie
sat heavily on the sidewalk and refused to
rise. That is, she didn't <i>say</i> that she
wouldn't rise. She remained sitting with
such firmness of purpose that it seemed
hopeless to attempt to break her of the habit.</p>

<p>Mabel walked round and round her firmly
seated charge in helpless despair. Rosa
Marie and the sidewalk were one.</p>

<p>"Want any help?" asked a friendly voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
It belonged to a large, freckled boy who was
carrying two pails of water from the lake
to one of the tumble-down houses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/i034.jpg" width="315" height="500" alt="Toddler on sidewalk with girl trying to lift her" />
<div class="caption">ROSA MARIE AND THE SIDEWALK WERE ONE.</div>
</div>

<p>"Yes, I do," responded Mabel, promptly.
"If you could just lift this child high
enough for me to get hold of her I think I
could carry her."</p>

<p>So the boy, setting his pails down, obligingly
lifted Rosa Marie's solid little person,
Mabel clasped the barrel-shaped body closely,
and, after a word of thanks to the kind boy,
proceeded homeward. But even now her
troubles were not ended. By silently refusing
to cuddle, Rosa Marie converted herself
into a most uncomfortable burden. Her entire
body was a silent protest against leaving
her home.</p>

<p>"Do make yourself soft and bunchy,"
pleaded Mabel, giving Rosa Marie sundry
pokes, calculated to make her double up like
a jack-knife. "Here, bend this way. <i>Haven't</i>
you any joints anywhere? Do hold tight
with your arms and legs. <i>This</i> way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Pshaw! You're just like a stuffed crocodile.
Well, <i>walk</i> then, if you can't hang on like a
real child. There's one thing certain, you
shan't sit down again. I s'pose we'll get
there <i>sometime</i>."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>Mabel's Day</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>ALMOST hopeless as it seemed at times,
Mabel and the silent brown baby
finally reached Dandelion Cottage. There
they found Jean, seated in a chair with her
lovely little cousin Anne Halliday perched
like a pink and white blossom on the edge
of the dining table before her, tying Anne's
bewitching yellow curls with wide pink
ribbons. Anne was a perpetual delight, for,
besides being a picture during every moment
of the long day, her ways were so quaint
and so attractive that no one could help
admiring her.</p>

<p>Marjory, her countenance carefully arranged
to depict the deepest sorrow, stood
guard over the Marcotte twins, who, touchingly
covered with nasturtiums, were laid out
on the parlor cozy corner, awaiting burial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Their blue eyes blinked and their pink toes
twitched; but, on the whole, they played
their parts in a most satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>Bettie, with two small but attractive
Tucker babies clinging to her brief skirts,
was exclaiming: "These are my jewels,"
when tired, dusty Mabel, pushing reluctant
Rosa Marie before her, walked in.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, what's that!" gasped
Jean, sweeping Anne Halliday into her protecting
arms.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is it something the cat dragged in?"
asked Marjory.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;<i>can</i> it be a <i>real</i> child?" demanded
Bettie.</p>

<p>"This," announced Mabel, with dignity,
"is <i>my</i> child. Her name is Rosa Marie&mdash;with
all the distress on the <i>ee</i>."</p>

<p>"The distress seems to be all over both
of you," giggled Marjory.</p>

<p>"That's just dust," explained Mabel.</p>

<p>"Did you both roll home like a pair of
barrels?" queried Jean, "or did the Village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Improvement folks use you to dust the sidewalks?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that child's complexion?"
demanded Marjory. "Is she
tanned?"</p>

<p>"Coming home took long enough for us
both to get tanned," returned Mabel, crossly,
"but Rosa Marie's French, I guess."</p>

<p>"French! French nothing!" exclaimed
Marjory. "She's nothing but a little wild
Indian. Look at her hair. Look at her
small black eyes. Look at her high cheekbones.
Where in the world did you get
her?"</p>

<p>Mabel explained. For once, the girls
listened with the most flattering attention.
Anne Halliday bobbed her pretty head to
punctuate each sentence, the Tucker babies
stood in silence with their mouths open, even
the nicely laid-out Marcotte twins on the
sofa sat up to hear the tale.</p>

<p>"And she's all mine until six o'clock,"
concluded Mabel, triumphantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"If she were mine," said Jean, "I'd give
her a bath."</p>

<p>"I'd give her two," giggled Marjory.</p>

<p>So Mabel, assisted by Jean, Marjory,
Bettie, little Anne, the two Tucker babies
and the now very much alive Marcotte twins
gave Rosa Marie a bath in the dish-pan.
Although they changed the water as fast as
they could heat more in the tea-kettle,
although they used a whole bar of strong
yellow soap, two teaspoonfuls of washing
powder and a <i>very</i> scratchy washcloth
lathered with Sapolio, Rosa Marie, who bore
it all with stolid patience, was still richly
brown from head to heels, when she emerged
from her bath.</p>

<p>"Let's play Pocohontis!" cried Marjory,
seizing the feather duster. "Put feathers
in her hair and drape her in my brown petticoat.
I'll be Captain John Smith in Bob
Tucker's rubber boots."</p>

<p>"You won't either," retorted Mabel, indignantly.
"I guess, after I dragged this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
child all the way up here to play 'Mother'
with, I'm not going to have her used for any
old Pocohontises. She's my child, and I'm
going to have the entire use of her while she
lasts."</p>

<p>"After all," replied Marjory, cuttingly,
"I don't want her. I'm sure <i>I</i> wouldn't
care for any of <i>that</i> colored children. The
usual shade is quite good enough for me."</p>

<p>But, while the novelty lasted and in spite
of Marjory's declaration, Rosa Marie was a
distinct success. Little Anne Halliday's
cunningest ways and quaintest speeches went
unheeded when Rosa Marie refused to wear
shoes and stockings. She had never worn
a shoe, and, without uttering a word, she
made it plain that she had no intention of
hampering her pudgy brown feet with the
cast-off footgear of the young Tuckers.</p>

<p>Neither would she wear clothes, until Jean
showed her the solitary garment she had
arrived in, now soaking in a pan of soapy
water. After they had arrayed her in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
long-sleeved apron of Anne's&mdash;it didn't go
round, but had to be helped out with a
cheese-cloth duster&mdash;it was evident that the
unaccustomed whiteness bothered her. She
was not used to being so remarkably stiff
and clean.</p>

<p>The Marcotte twins, again prepared for
burial, quarrelled most engagingly as to
which should be buried under the apple-tree,
both preferring that fruitful resting-place
to the barren waste under the snowball
bush; but nobody listened because Rosa
Marie was doing extraordinary things with
her bowl of bread and milk. Having
lapped the milk like a cat, she was deftly
chasing the crumbs round the bowl with a
greedy and experienced tongue. It was
plain that Rosa Marie had no table manners.</p>

<p>As for the infantile Tuckers, they were
an old story. On this occasion they
crawled into the corner cupboard and went
to sleep and nobody missed them for a whole
hour, just because Rosa Marie was emitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
queer little startled grunts every time Marjory's
best doll wailed "Mam-mah!" "Pap-pah!"
for her benefit. There was no doubt
about it, Rosa Marie was decidedly
amusing.</p>

<p>The day passed swiftly; much too swiftly,
Mabel thought. Very much mothered
Rosa Marie, who had obligingly consumed
an amazing amount of milk&mdash;all, indeed,
that the Cottagers had been able to procure&mdash;started
homeward, towed by Mabel. That
elated young person had declined all offers
of company; she coveted the full glory of
returning Rosa Marie to her rightful guardian.
Mabel, indeed, was visibly swollen
with pride. She had given the Cottagers a
most unusual treat. She had not only surprised
them by proving that she <i>could</i> borrow
a baby, but had kept them amused and
entertained every moment of the day. It
had certainly been a red-letter day in the
annals of Dandelion Cottage.</p>

<p>Mabel more than half expected to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Rosa Marie's mother at the very first corner.
The other real mothers had always seemed
desirous&mdash;over desirous, Mabel thought&mdash;of
welcoming their home-coming babies back
to the fold; but the mother of Rosa Marie,
apparently, was of a less grudging disposition.</p>

<p>Mabel laboriously escorted her reluctant
charge to the very door of the shanty without
encountering any welcoming parent.
The borrower of Rosa Marie knocked. No
one came. She tried the door. It was
locked.</p>

<p>"How queer!" said Mabel. "Seems to
me I'd be on hand if I had an engagement at
exactly six o'clock. But then, I always <i>am</i>
late."</p>

<p>Dragging an empty wooden box to the
side of the house, Mabel climbed to the high,
decidedly smudgy window and peered in.</p>

<p>There was no one inside. There was no
fire in the battered stove. The doors of a
rough cupboard opposite the window stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
open, disclosing the fact that the cupboard
was bare. There were no bedclothes in the
rough bunk that served for a bed; no dishes
on the table; no clothing hanging from the
hooks on the wall. Both inside and outside
the house wore a strangely deserted aspect.
It seemed to say: "Nobody lives here now,
nobody ever did live here, nobody ever will
live here."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>An Unusual Evening</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>MABEL looked in dismay at Rosa
Marie.</p>

<p>"Where do you s'pose your mother is?"
she demanded.</p>

<p>It was useless, however, to question Rosa
Marie. That stolid young person was as
uncommunicative as what Marjory called
"the little stuffed Indians in the Washington
Museum." The Indians to whom Marjory
referred were made of wax. Rosa
Marie seemed more like a little wooden
Indian. The countenance of little Anne
Halliday changed with every moment; but
Rosa Marie's wore only one expression.
Perhaps it had only one to wear.</p>

<p>"I say," said Mabel, gently shaking her
small brown charge by the shoulders, "where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
does your mother usually go when she isn't
home?"</p>

<p>A surprised grunt was the only response.</p>

<p>Rosa Marie, too suddenly released, sat
heavily on the ground, thoughtfully
scratched up the surface and filled her lap
with handfuls of loose, unattractive earth.</p>

<p>"Goodness! What an untidy child!"
cried Mabel, snatching her up and shaking
her, although Rosa Marie's weight made her
youthful guardian stagger. "I wanted
your mother to see you clean, for once.
Here, sit on this stick of wood. I s'pose
we'll just have to wait and wait until somebody
comes. Well, <i>sit</i> in the sand if you
want to. I'm tired of picking you up."</p>

<p>Rosa Marie's home was in rather an attractive
spot. The big, quiet lake was
smooth as glass, and every object along its
picturesque bank was mirrored faithfully in
the quiet depths. The western sky was
faintly tinged with red. Against it the
spires and tall roofs of the town stood out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sharply; but at this quiet hour they seemed
very far away.</p>

<p>Mabel, seated on the wooden box that she
had placed under the window, leaned back
against the house and clasped her hands
about her knees, while she gazed dreamily
at the picture and listened with enjoyment
to the faint lap of the quiet water on the
pebbled beach.</p>

<p>Both Mabel and Rosa Marie had had a
busy day. Both had taken unusual exercise.
And now all the sights and sounds were
soothing, soothing.</p>

<p>You can guess what happened. Both little
girls fell asleep. Rosa Marie, flat on her
stomach, pillowed her head on her chubby
arms. Mabel's head, drooping slowly forward,
grew heavier and heavier until finally
it touched her knees.</p>

<p>An hour later, the sleepy head had grown
so very heavy that it pulled Mabel right off
the box and tumbled her over in a confused,
astonished heap on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"My goodness!" gasped Mabel, still on
hands and knees. "Where am I, anyway?
Is this Saturday or Sunday? Why! It's all
dark. This&mdash;this isn't my room&mdash;why!
why! I'm outdoors! How did I get outdoors?"</p>

<p>Mabel stood up, took a step forward,
stumbled over Rosa Marie and went down
on all-fours.</p>

<p>"What's that!" gasped bewildered Mabel,
groping with her hands. She felt the rough
black head, the plump body, the round legs,
the bare feet of her sleeping charge.
Memory returned.</p>

<p>"Why! It's Rosa Marie, and we're waiting
here by the lake for her mother. It&mdash;ugh!
It must be midnight!"</p>

<p>But it wasn't. It was just exactly twenty
minutes after seven o'clock but, with the
autumn sun gone early to bed, it certainly
seemed very much later. The house was
still deserted.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Mabel, feeling about in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the dark for Rosa Marie's fat hand, "we'd
better go home&mdash;or some place. Come,
Rosa Marie, wake up. I'm going to take
you home with me. Oh, <i>please</i> wake up.
There's nobody here but us. It's way in the
middle of the night and there might be <i>any</i>thing
in those awfully black bushes."</p>

<p>But Rosa Marie, deprived of her noontide
nap, slumbered on. Mabel shook her.</p>

<p>"Do hurry," pleaded frightened Mabel.
"I don't like it here."</p>

<p>It was anything but an easy task for Mabel
to drag the sleeping child to her feet, but she
did it. Rosa Marie, however, immediately
dropped to earth again. During the day she
had seemed stiff; but now, unfortunately,
she proved most distressingly limber. She
seemed, in fact, to possess more than the
usual number of joints, and discouraged
Mabel began to fear that each joint was reversible.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" breathed Mabel, when Rosa
Marie's knees failed for the seventh time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
"it seems wicked to shake you <i>very</i> hard,
but I've got to."</p>

<p>Even with vigorous and prolonged shakings
it took time to get Rosa Marie firmly
established on her feet, and the children had
walked more than a block of the homeward
way before Rosa Marie opened one blinking
eye under the street lamp.</p>

<p>If it had been difficult to make the uphill
journey in broad daylight with Rosa Marie
wide awake and moderately willing, it was
now a doubly difficult matter with that young
person half or three-quarters asleep and most
decidedly unwilling.</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness," grumbled Mabel,
stumbling along in the dark, "that I'd borrowed
a real baby and not a heathen."</p>

<p>The longest journey has an end. The
children reached Dandelion Cottage at last.
Mabel found the key, unlocked the door,
tumbled Rosa Marie, clothes and all, into the
middle of the spare-room bed; waited just
long enough to make certain that the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
baby slept; then, reassured by gentle, half-breed
snores, Mabel, still supposing the time
to be midnight, ran home, climbed into her
own bed nearly an hour earlier than usual
and was soon sound asleep. Her mind was
too full of other matters to wonder why the
front door was unlocked at so late an hour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett, dressing to go to a party,
heard her daughter come in.</p>

<p>"How fortunate!" said she. "Now I
shan't have to go to Jean's and Marjory's
and Bettie's to hunt for Mabel. She must
be tired to-night&mdash;she doesn't often go to
bed so early."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>Returning Rosa Marie</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>EARLY the next morning, Jean, needing
her thimble to sew on a vitally necessary
button, ran to the supposedly empty cottage
to get it. Taking the short cut through
the Tuckers' back yard she found Bettie
feeding Billy, the seagull, one of Bob's
numerous pets.</p>

<p>"Billy always wakes everybody up crying
for his breakfast," explained thoughtful little
Bettie. "Bob's spending a week at the
Ormsbees' camp, so I have to get up to feed
Billy so father can sleep."</p>

<p>"Why don't the other boys do it?"</p>

<p>"Mercy! <i>They'd</i> sleep through anything.
Going to the Cottage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, come with me," returned Jean,
"while I get my thimble. It's so big that it
almost takes two to carry it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," laughed Bettie, crawling
through the hole in the fence.</p>

<p>Jean's thimble was a standing joke. A
stout and prudent godmother had bestowed
a very large one on the little girl so that Jean
would be in no danger of outgrowing the
gift. Jean was now living in hopes of sometime
growing big enough to fit the thimble.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Jean, after a brief
search, "the key isn't under the doormat!
Where do you s'pose it's gone?"</p>

<p>"Here it is in the door. But how in the
world did it get there? I locked that door
myself last night and tucked the key under
the mat. I <i>know</i> I did."</p>

<p>"I saw you do it," corroborated Jean.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Marjory's inside."</p>

<p>"It isn't Mabel, anyway. She's always
the last one up."</p>

<p>"Mercy me!" cried Bettie, who had been
peeking into the different rooms to see if
Marjory were inside. "Come here, Jean.
Just look at this!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"This" was brown little Rosa Marie sitting
up in the middle of the pink and white
spare-room bed, like, as Bettie put it, a brown
bee in the heart of a rose. Her small dark
countenance was absolutely expressionless, so
there was no way of discovering what <i>she</i>
thought about it all.</p>

<p>"My sakes!" exclaimed Jean, with indignation,
"that lazy Mabel never took her
home, after all! Why! We'll have a whole
band of wild Indians coming to scalp us
right after breakfast! How <i>could</i> she have
been so careless. This is the worst she's
done yet."</p>

<p>"But it's just like Mabel," said Bettie,
giving vent, for once, to her disapproval of
Mabel's thoughtlessness. "She likes things
ever so much at first. Then she simply forgets
that they ever existed."</p>

<p>"Who forgets?" demanded Mabel, bouncing
in at the front door.</p>

<p>"You," returned Jean and Bettie, with
one accusing voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Prove it."</p>

<p>"You forgot to take Rosa Marie home
last night."</p>

<p>"I never did. I took her every inch of
the way home, stayed with her all alone in
the dark for pretty nearly a <i>year</i>, and then
had to bring her all the way back again,
walking in her sleep. So there, now!"</p>

<p>"But why in the world didn't you leave
her with her own folks?"</p>

<p>"Her horrid mother wasn't there. And
between 'em, I didn't get any supper and
only a little sleep."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do?" queried
astonished Jean.</p>

<p>"After she drinks this quart of milk," explained
Mabel, "I'm going to take her home
again."</p>

<p>"Where did you get so much milk?"
asked Bettie, suspiciously.</p>

<p>Mabel colored furiously. "I begged it
from the milkman," she confessed. "That's
why I'm up so early. I've been sitting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
our kitchen doorstep for two hours, waiting
for him to come."</p>

<p>Mabel spent all that day industriously returning
Rosa Marie to a home that had
locked its doors against her. No pretty,
dark, French mother stood in the doorway.
No tall, dark man wandered about the yard.
No neighbor came from the tumbling houses
across the street to explain the woman's
puzzling absence.</p>

<p>It proved a most tiresome day. Mabel
was not only mentally weary from trying to
solve the mystery, but physically tired also
from dragging Rosa Marie up and down the
hill between Dandelion Cottage and the
child's deserted home. The girls went with
her once, but, having satisfied their curiosity
as to Rosa Marie's abiding-place, turned
their attention to pleasanter tasks. Walking
with Rosa Marie was too much like
traveling with a snail. One such journey
was enough.</p>

<p>Moreover, Mabel's pride had suffered. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
grinning boy, looking from plump Mabel's
ruddy countenance to fat Rosa Marie's expressionless
brown one, had asked wickedly:</p>

<p>"Is that your sister? You look enough
alike to be twins."</p>

<p>After that, Mabel feared that other persons
might mistake the small brown person
for a relative of hers, or, worse yet, mistake
her for an Indian.</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" groaned Mabel, toiling
homeward from her second trip, "it was
hard enough to borrow a baby, but it's
enough sight worse getting rid of one afterwards.
There's one thing certain; I'll <i>never</i>
borrow another."</p>

<p>Late in the day Mabel thought of
Mrs. Malony, the egg-woman. Perhaps she
would know what had become of Rosa
Marie's vanished mother. Dropping Rosa
Marie inside the gate, Mabel knocked at
Mrs. Malony's door.</p>

<p>"The folks that lived in the shanty beyant?"
asked Mrs. Malony. "Sure, darlint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
nobody's lived there for years and years save
gipsies and tramps and such like."</p>

<p>"But day before yesterday&mdash;no, yesterday
morning&mdash;I saw a young Frenchwoman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A black-eyed gal wid two long braids
and wan small Injin? Sure, Oi know the
wan you mane. Her man, Injin Pete, died
a month ago, some two days after they come
to the shack."</p>

<p>"But where is she now?" asked Mabel.</p>

<p>"Lord love ye," returned Mrs. Malony,
"how wud Oi be after knowin'? She came
and she wint, like the rest av thim."</p>

<p>"There was a man&mdash;not a gentleman and
not exactly a tramp&mdash;talking to her yesterday.
Perhaps you know where <i>he</i> is. I
couldn't find <i>anybody</i>."</p>

<p>"Depind upon it," said Mrs. Malony,
easily, "she's gone wid him. She's Mrs.
Somebody Else by now, and good riddance
to the pair av thim."</p>

<p>"But," objected Mabel, drawing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
branches of a small shrub aside and disclosing
Rosa Marie sprawling on the ground behind
it, "she left her baby."</p>

<p>"The Nation, she did!" gasped Mrs.
Malony, for once surprised out of her serenity.
"Wud ye think of thot, now!"</p>

<p>"I've <i>been</i> thinking of it," returned
Mabel, miserably. "And I don't know what
in the world to do. You see, she left the
baby with <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Take her home wid ye," advised Mrs.
Malony, hastily; so hastily that it looked as
if the Irishwoman feared that <i>she</i> might be
asked to mother Rosa Marie. "I'll kape an
eye on the shack for ye. If that good-for-nothin'
black-haired wan comes back, Oi'll
be up wid the news in two shakes of a dead
lamb's tail, so Oi will. In the mane toime,
be a mother to thot innocent babe yourself.
She needs wan if iver a choild did."</p>

<p>"I've been that for two whole days now,"
groaned Mabel.</p>

<p>"Thot's right, thot's right," encouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Mrs. Malony. "Ye were just cut out for
thot same. Good luck go wid ye."</p>

<p>Rosa Marie spent a second night in the
spare room of Dandelion Cottage. She, at
least, seemed utterly indifferent as to her
fate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>The Dark Secret</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE four Cottagers sat in solemn conclave
round the dining-room table next
morning. Rosa Marie, flat on her stomach
on the floor, lapped milk like a cat and
licked the bowl afterwards; but now no one
paid the slightest attention.</p>

<p>"I think," said Jean, removing her elbows
from the table, "that we'd better tell our
mothers and Aunty Jane all about it at once.
They'll know what to do."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Marjory.</p>

<p>"So do I," echoed Bettie.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't," protested Mabel, whose hitherto
serene countenance now showed signs of
great anxiety. "If you ever tell <i>anybody</i>,
I'll&mdash;I'll never speak to you again. This
joke&mdash;if it <i>is</i> a joke&mdash;is on <i>me</i>. I got into
this scrape and it's <i>my</i> scrape."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," objected Jean, "we always do tell
our mothers everything. That's why they
trust us to play all by ourselves in Dandelion
Cottage."</p>

<p>"Give me just a few days," pleaded
Mabel. "Perhaps that woman got kept
away by some accident. I'm sure Rosa
Marie's mother has mother feelings inside of
her, <i>some</i> place&mdash;I saw 'em in her face when
I was leading Rosa Marie away. I <i>know</i>
she'll come back. Until she does, I'll take
care of that poor deserted child myself."</p>

<p>"It's a blessing she never cries, anyway,"
observed Bettie. "If she were a howling
child I don't know <i>what</i> we'd do. As it is,
she's not <i>much</i> more trouble than a Teddy
bear."</p>

<p>If Mrs. Mapes hadn't had a missionary
box in her cellar to pack for Reservation
Indians of assorted sizes and shapes with the
cast-off garments of all Lakeville; if Mrs.
Bennett had not been exceedingly busy with
a seamstress getting ready to go out of town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
for an important visit; if Aunty Jane had
not been even busier trying to make green
tomato pickles out of ripe tomatoes; if Mrs.
Tucker had not been too anxious about the
throats of the youngest three Tuckers to give
heed to the doings of the larger members
of her family, these four good women would
surely have discovered that something unusual
was taking place under the Cottage
roof. As it was, not one of the mothers,
not even sharp Aunty Jane, discovered that
the Cottagers were borrowing an amazing
amount of milk from their respective refrigerators.</p>

<p>The novelty worn off, Rosa Marie became
a heavy burden to at least three of the Cottagers'
tender consciences. Mabel's conscience
may have troubled her, but not enough
to be noticed by a pair of moderately
careless parents. Mabel, however, grew
more and more attached to Rosa Marie; the
others did not. To tell the truth, the borrowed
infant was not an attractive child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Many small Indians are decidedly pretty,
but Rosa Marie was not. Her small eyes
were too close together, her upper lip was
much too long for the rest of her countenance
and her large mouth turned sharply down
at the corners. But loyal Mabel was blind
to these defects. She saw only the babyish
roundness of Rosa Marie's body, the cunning
dimples in her elbows and the affectionate
gleam that sometimes showed in the
small black eyes. But then, it was always
Mabel who found beauty in the stray dogs
and cats that no one else would have on the
premises. During these trying days the
Cottagers <i>almost</i> quarreled.</p>

<p>"That child is all cheeks," complained
Marjory, petulantly. "They positively hang
down. Do you suppose we're giving her too
much milk? She's disgustingly fat, and she
hasn't any figure."</p>

<p>"She has altogether too much figure," declared
Jean, almost crossly. "I fastened
this little petticoat around what I <i>thought</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was her waist and it slid right off. So
now I've got to make buttonholes. Such a
nuisance!"</p>

<p>"Pity you can't use tacks and a hammer,"
giggled Marjory.</p>

<p>The clothing of Rosa Marie had presented
another distressing problem. She owned
absolutely nothing in the way of a wardrobe.
The single, unattractive garment she had
worn on her arrival had not survived the
girls' attempts to wash it. They had left it
boiling on the stove, the water had cooked
off and the faded gingham had cooked also.</p>

<p>To make up for this accident, all four of
the Cottagers had contributed all they could
find of their own cast-off garments; but
these of course were much too large without
considerable making over.</p>

<p>"If," said Jean, reproachfully, as she took
a large tuck in the grown-up stocking that
she was trying to re-model for Rosa Marie,
"you'd only let me tell my mother, she'd
give us every blessed thing we need. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
live little Indian in the hand ought to be
worth more to her than a whole dozen invisible
ones on a way-off Reservation; and
you know she's always doing things for
<i>them</i>."</p>

<p>"Jeanie Mapes!" threatened Mabel, "if
you tell her, that's the very last breath I'll
ever speak to you."</p>

<p>"I'll be good," sighed Jean, "but I just
hate <i>not</i> telling her. And this horrid stocking
is <i>still</i> too long."</p>

<p>"Button it about her neck," giggled Marjory,
who flatly declined to do any sewing
for Rosa Marie. "That'll take up the slack
and save making her a shirt."</p>

<p>"Don't bother about stockings," said Bettie,
fishing a round lump from her blouse.
"Here's a pair of old ones that I found in
the rag bag. One's black and the other's
tan; but they're exactly the right size and
that's <i>something</i>."</p>

<p>"What's the use," demurred Marjory.
"She won't wear them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"If Rosa Marie were about eight shades
slimmer," said Jean, "I could easily get
some of Anne Halliday's dear little dresses&mdash;her
mother gave my mother a lot day before
yesterday for that Reservation box; but
goodness! You'd have to sew two of them
together sideways to get them around <i>that</i>
child."</p>

<p>"She <i>is</i> awfully thick," admitted Mabel.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, dressing Rosa Marie was
not exactly a hardship. Indeed, it is probable
that the difficulties that stood in the way
made the task only so much the more interesting;
then, of course, dressing a real
child was much more exciting than making
garments for a mere doll.</p>

<p>Whenever the Cottagers spoke of Rosa
Marie outside the Cottage they referred to
her as the D. S. D. S. stood for "Dark
Secret." This seemed singularly appropriate,
for Rosa Marie was certainly dark and
quite as certainly a most tremendous secret&mdash;a
far larger and darker secret than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
troubled girls cared to keep, but there seemed
to be no immediate way out of it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the stolid little "D. S." was
amiable to an astonishing degree. She never
cried. Also, she "stayed put." If Mabel
stood her in the corner she stayed there. If
she were tucked into bed, there she remained
until some one dragged her out. She spent
her days rolling contentedly about the Cottage
floor, her nights in deep, calm slumber.
Never was there a youngster with fewer
wants. Teaching Rosa Marie to talk furnished
the Cottagers with great amusement.
The round brown damsel very evidently preferred
grunts to words; but she was always
willing to grunt obligingly when Mabel or
the others insisted.</p>

<p>"Say, 'This little pig went to market,'"
Mabel would prompt.</p>

<p>"Eigh, ugh, ugh, ee, ee, <i>ee</i>, hee!" Rosa
Marie would grunt.</p>

<p>Then, when everybody else laughed her
very hardest, Rosa Marie's grim little mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
would relax to show for an instant the row
of white teeth that Mabel scrubbed industriously
many times a day. This rare smile
made the borrowed baby almost attractive.
But not to Marjory. From the first, Marjory
regarded her with strong disapproval.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Mabel's secret, little Anne
Halliday, the Marcotte twins and the two
Tucker babies were too small to tell tales out
of school, so in spite of sundry narrow
escapes, Rosa Marie remained as dark a
secret as one's heart could desire.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>Discovery</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>SCHOOL began the first day of October&mdash;fortunately,
repairs to the building had
delayed the opening. And there was Rosa
Marie still on the Cottagers' hands, still a
dark and undivulged secret. In the meantime,
Mabel had paid many a visit to Mrs.
Malony, who for reasons of her own had
kept silence about the borrowed baby.
Probably she felt that Mrs. Bennett would
blame her for advising Mabel to harbor the
deserted child.</p>

<p>"No, darlint," Mrs. Malony would say,
encouragingly. "Oi ain't exactly <i>seen</i> her,
but she'll be back prisintly, she'll be back
prisintly&mdash;Oh, most anny toime, now. Just
do be waitin' patient and you'll see me come
walkin' in most anny foine day wid yon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
blackhaired lass at me heels an' full to the
eyes of her wid gratichude. Anny day at
all, Miss Mabel."</p>

<p>Buoyed by this hope, Mabel had waited
from day to day, hoping for speedy deliverance.
And now, school!</p>

<p>"We'll just have to get excused for part
of each day," said Marjory, always good at
suggesting remedies. "Last year, all my
recitations came in the morning; perhaps
they will again. Then, if one of you others
could do all your reciting during the afternoon
we could manage it."</p>

<p>The year previously Mabel had been
obliged to spend many a half-hour after
school, making up neglected lessons. Now,
however, she studied furiously. If she
failed frequently it was only because she
couldn't help making absurd blunders; it was
never for lack of study. In this one way, at
least, Rosa Marie proved beneficial.</p>

<p>The united efforts of all four made it
possible for Rosa Marie to possess a more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
less unwilling guardian for all but one hour
during the forenoon. It grieves one to confess
it, but Rosa Marie spent that solitary
hour securely strapped to the leg of the dining-room
table; but, stolid as ever, she did
not mind that.</p>

<p>It was there that Aunty Jane discovered
her, the second week in October. Aunty
Jane had missed her best saucepan. Rightly
suspecting that Marjory had carried it off to
make fudge in, she hurried to the Cottage,
discovered the key under the door-mat,
opened the door and walked in.</p>

<p>Rosa Marie was grunting. "Eigh, ugh,
ugh, ee, ee, <i>ee</i>, hee!" to her own bare
brown toes.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake! What's that?"
gasped Aunty Jane, with a terrified start.
"There's some sort of an animal in this
house."</p>

<p>Arming herself with the broken umbrella
that stood in the mended umbrella jar in the
front hall, Aunty Jane peered cautiously into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the dining-room. The "animal" turned its
head to blink with mild, expressionless curiosity
at Aunty Jane.</p>

<p>"My soul!" ejaculated that good lady,
"what are you, anyway?"</p>

<p>The pair blinked at each other for several
moments.</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;are you a <i>baby</i>?" demanded
Aunty Jane.</p>

<p>No response from Rosa Marie.</p>

<p>"What," asked Aunty Jane, cautiously
drawing closer, "is your name?"</p>

<p>Still no response.</p>

<p>"Who tied you to that table?"</p>

<p>Silence on Rosa Marie's part.</p>

<p>"I'm going straight after Mrs. Mapes,"
declared Aunty Jane, retreating backwards
in order to keep a watchful eye on the queer
object under the table. "I might have
known that those enterprising youngsters
would be up to <i>something</i>, if I gave my
whole mind to pickles."</p>

<p>Excited Aunty Jane collected not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Mrs. Mapes, but Mrs. Tucker and Mrs.
Bennett, before she returned to the Cottage.
And then, the three mothers and Aunty Jane
sat on the floor beside Rosa Marie and asked
questions; useless questions, because Rosa
Marie licked the table-leg bashfully but
yielded no other reply.</p>

<p>This lasted for nearly half an hour. And
then, school being out and the four Cottagers
discovering their front door wide open, Jean,
Bettie, Marjory and Mabel, all sorts of emotions
tugging at their hearts, rushed breathlessly
in. On beholding their mothers and
Aunty Jane, they, too, turned suddenly bashful
and leaned, speechless, against the Cottage
wall.</p>

<p>"Whose child is that?" demanded all
four of the grown-ups, in concert.</p>

<p>"Mine," replied Mabel.</p>

<p>"Mabel's," responded the other three,
with disheartening promptness.</p>

<p>"What!" gasped the parents and Aunty
Jane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I borrowed her," explained Mabel, "so
she's <i>mostly</i> mine."</p>

<p>"She's spending the day here, I suppose,"
said Mrs. Mapes.</p>

<p>"Ye-es," faltered Mabel. Marjory giggled,
and Mabel turned crimson.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Mrs. Bennett, severely,
"that you're not thinking of keeping her all
night."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;we&mdash;" faltered Mabel, "we&mdash;we
sort of did."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Mrs. Bennett, not
knowing how very late she was, "I guess
we've come just in time. Mabel, put that
child's things on and take her home at once."</p>

<p>"I can't," replied Mabel.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"She hasn't any home."</p>

<p>"No home!"</p>

<p>"No. It's&mdash;it's run away."</p>

<p>"What! That baby?"</p>

<p>"No," stammered Mabel, "that baby's
home. Not&mdash;not the house. Just her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mother. She&mdash;she&mdash;Oh, she'll be back,
<i>some</i> day."</p>

<p>"Mabel Bennett!" demanded Mrs. Bennett,
suspecting something of the truth,
"how long have you had that child here?"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;Oh, not so <i>very</i> long," evaded
Mabel.</p>

<p>"Mabel," demanded her mother, "tell me,
instantly, exactly how long?"</p>

<p>"About&mdash;yes, just about five weeks."</p>

<p>"Five weeks!" gasped Mrs. Bennett.</p>

<p>"Five <i>weeks</i>!" shrieked Mrs. Tucker.</p>

<p>"Five weeks!" groaned Mrs. Mapes.</p>

<p>"Fi&mdash;ve weeks!" cried Aunty Jane.</p>

<p>"It'll be five to-morrow," said Bettie.</p>

<p>"No, the day after," corrected Marjory.</p>

<p>For the next few moments the mothers
and Aunty Jane were too astounded for
further speech. The girls, too, had nothing
to say. All four of the Cottagers kept their
eyes on the floor, for they knew precisely
what their elders were thinking.</p>

<p>"Jean," began Mrs. Mapes, reproachfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I <i>wanted</i> to tell," stammered Jean.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't let her," defended Mabel,
looking up. "They <i>all</i> wanted to tell, but I
wouldn't let them. Truly, they did, Mrs.
Mapes."</p>

<p>"But five whole weeks!" murmured Mrs.
Bennett. "I wonder that you were able to
keep the secret so long. Why! I've been
over here half a dozen times at least to ask
for my scissors and other things that Mabel
has carried off."</p>

<p>"So have I," said Mrs. Mapes.</p>

<p>"So have I," echoed Mrs. Tucker.</p>

<p>"And so have I," added Aunty Jane,
"and I've never heard a sound from that remarkable
child."</p>

<p>"You see," confessed Bettie, flushing
guiltily, "we kept the door locked. Whenever
we saw anybody coming we whisked
Rosa Marie into the spare-room closet."</p>

<p>"If Rosa Marie had been an ordinary
child," explained Jean, "she would probably
have howled; but you see, every blessed thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
about us was so new and strange to her that
she just thought that everything we did was
all right. And anyhow, she doesn't have
the same sort of feelings that Anne Halliday
does. Anne would have cried."</p>

<p>"You naughty, naughty children,"
scolded Mrs. Mapes, "to keep a secret like
that for five whole weeks."</p>

<p>"But, Mother," protested Jean, gently,
"we never supposed it was going to be a five-weeks-long
secret. We didn't <i>want</i> it to be.
We've been expecting her horrid mother to
turn up every single minute since Rosa
Marie came."</p>

<p>"It was all my fault," declared loyal
Mabel. "<i>They'd</i> have told, the very first
minute, if it hadn't been for me. Blame me
for everything."</p>

<p>"What," asked Mrs. Bennett, "do you
intend to do with that&mdash;that atrocious
child?"</p>

<p>"She <i>isn't</i> atrocious!" blazed Mabel,
with sudden fire. "She's a perfect darling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
when you get used to her, and I <i>love</i> her.
She isn't so very pretty, I know, but she's
just dear. She's good, and that&mdash;and that's&mdash;Why!
You've said, yourself, that it was
better to be good than beautiful."</p>

<p>"But what do you intend to do with
her?" persisted Mrs. Bennett.</p>

<p>"Keep her," said Mabel, firmly. "She
doesn't eat anything much but milk and
sample packages."</p>

<p>"You can't. I won't have her in my
house. Why! Her parents are probably
dreadful people."</p>

<p>"That's why she ought to have me for a
mother and you for a grandmother," pleaded
Mabel, earnestly. "But if you don't like
her, I'll keep her here."</p>

<p>"But you can't, Mabel. It's so cold that
there ought to be a fire here this minute, and
you can't possibly leave a child alone with a
fire."</p>

<p>"Couldn't <i>you</i> take her, Mrs. Mapes?"
pleaded Mabel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid I couldn't. If she were
the least bit lovable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, she <i>is</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not to me," returned Mrs. Mapes,
firmly.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't <i>you</i> take her, Mrs. Tucker?"</p>

<p>"What! With all the family I have now?
I couldn't think of such a thing."</p>

<p>"Then you," begged Mabel, turning to
Aunty Jane. "There's only you and Marjory
in that great big house. Oh, <i>do</i> take
her."</p>

<p>"Mercy! I'd just as soon undertake to
board a live bear! Why! Nobody wants a
child of <i>that</i> sort around. She's as
homely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm extremely glad," said Mabel, with
much dignity and a great deal of emphasis,
"that <i>my</i> child doesn't understand grown-up
English."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Mrs. Mapes, smiling
with sympathetic understanding, "we four
older people had better talk this matter over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
by ourselves. Suppose you walk home with
me.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think," said Aunty Jane, forgetting all
about the saucepan that had led her to the
Cottage, "that the orphan asylum is the
place for that unspeakable child."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mrs. Bennett, "she'll certainly
have to go to the asylum."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>The Fugitive Soldier</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE Cottage door closed behind the
three excited parents and Aunty Jane.
The four Cottagers, all decidedly pale and
subdued, looked at one another in silence.
It is one thing to confess a fault; it is quite
another to be ignominiously found out.
Jean and Bettie and Marjory were feeling
this very keenly; but Mabel was far more
troubled at the prospect of losing Rosa
Marie.</p>

<p>"The orphan asylum!" breathed Bettie,
at length.</p>

<p>"It's wicked," blazed Mabel, "to make an
orphan of a person that isn't."</p>

<p>"I've heard," said Marjory, reflectively,
"that orphans have to eat fried liver."</p>

<p>"Horrors!" gasped Mabel.</p>

<p>"And codfish."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh <i>horrors</i>!" moaned Mabel, who detested
both liver and codfish.</p>

<p>"And prunes," pursued teasing Marjory,
wickedly remembering Mabel's dislike for
that wholesome but insipid fruit. The
prunes proved entirely too much for Mabel.</p>

<p>"Pup&mdash;pup&mdash;prunes!" she sobbed. "And
you stand there and don't do a thing to save
her! I guess if I were Eliza escaping with
my baby on cakes of ice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rosa Marie's about the right color,"
giggled Marjory, who could not resist so
fine an opportunity to tease excitable Mabel.</p>

<p>"You'd all be glad enough to help, but
when it's just me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll help," soothed Jean, slipping
an arm about Mabel. "You know we
always do stand by you."</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll all help," promised Bettie, "if
you'll just tell us what to do. Only <i>please</i>
don't get us into any more trouble with our
mothers."</p>

<p>"There's the cellar," suggested Mabel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
doubtfully, yet with glimmerings of hope.
"I read a story once about a lady who sat
on a cellar door, knitting stockings."</p>

<p>"Why in the world," demanded Marjory,
"did she sit on the door?"</p>

<p>"Some soldiers were hunting for an
escaped prisoner and she had him hidden
there."</p>

<p>"Was the cellar all horrid with old papers
and rats and mice and spiders and crawly
things with legs?" asked Bettie, with
interest.</p>

<p>"I hope not," shuddered Mabel, "but a
soldier wouldn't mind. Dear me, I wish
we'd cleaned that cellar when we first came
into the Cottage. If we had, it'd be just the
place to hide Rosa Marie in."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it isn't too late, now," said
Marjory, stooping to loosen the ring in the
kitchen floor. "Let's look down there, anyway."</p>

<p>"Let's," agreed Bettie. "It'll be something
to do, at least."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody helped with the door. When
it was open and propped against the kitchen
stove, the four girls crouched down to peer
into the depths below. Even Rosa Marie,
who had been released from the table-leg,
crept to the edge to look.</p>

<p>They were not very deep depths. The
place was filled with rubbish, mostly old
papers and broken pasteboard boxes; but it
was perfectly dry, and clean except for a
thick layer of dust.</p>

<p>"Let's clean it out," said Mabel, recklessly
grasping an armful of dusty papers
and dragging them forth.</p>

<p>"Phew!" exclaimed Jean, tumbling back
from the hole. "Er&mdash;er&mdash;er hash!"</p>

<p>"Oh, ki&mdash;<i>hash</i>! Hoo!" blubbered Bettie,
likewise tumbling backwards.</p>

<p>"Who-is-she, who-is-she," sneezed Marjory.</p>

<p>"Kerchoo, kerchoo, kerchoo!" sneezed
Rosa Marie, her head bobbing with each
sneeze. "Kerchoo, kerchoo!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's pepper," explained Mabel, when she
had finished <i>her</i> sneeze. "I spilled a lot of
it the day of Mr. Black's dinner party. I
didn't know what else to do with it, so I
swept it down that biggest crack."</p>

<p>"Goodness! What a housekeeper!" rebuked
Jean, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>"It's good for moths," consoled Bettie.
"At any rate, Rosa Marie won't get moth-eaten."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Mabel, hopefully,
"it's driven away all the rats and crawly
things."</p>

<p>Working more cautiously, the girls drew
forth the yellowed papers and pasteboard
left by some former untidy occupant of the
Cottage. They burned most of the rubbish
in the kitchen stove, Jean standing guard lest
burning pieces should escape to set fire to the
Cottage. The work of clearing the cellar,
indeed, was precisely what the girls needed,
after the humiliating events of the day. All
four were growing more cheerful; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
worked as swiftly as they dared, for they
felt certain that the cellar, as a place of concealment
for Rosa Marie, would be speedily
needed.</p>

<p>The cellar proved to be a square hole
about three feet deep. When Mabel, who
for once was doing the lion's share of the
work, had swept the boarded floor and sides
perfectly clean, it was really a very tidy, inviting
little shelter; as neat a shelter as fugitive
soldier could desire.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mabel, "we'll put a piece of
carpet and an old quilt in the bottom, tack
clean papers around the sides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Papers rattle," offered Marjory, sagely.</p>

<p>"Then we'll use cloth," declared Mabel,
snatching an apron from the hook behind
the door. "We'll begin right away to
practise with Rosa Marie, so she'll get used
to it. Then we must rehearse our parts,
too."</p>

<p>The retreat ready, Rosa Marie went without
a murmur into the underground babytender&mdash;Marjory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
gave it that name. Rosa
Marie, at least, would do her part successfully.
But it was different above ground.</p>

<p>"Who," demanded Jean, "is to sit on the
door and knit? <i>I</i> couldn't&mdash;I'd fly to
pieces."</p>

<p>"It's my child," said Mabel, "<i>I'm</i> going
to."</p>

<p>"But," objected Marjory, "you <i>can't</i>
knit. You don't know how."</p>

<p>"I can crochet," triumphed Mabel, "and
I guess that's every bit as good."</p>

<p>"Where," asked Bettie, "is your crochet
hook?"</p>

<p>But that, of course, was a question that
Mabel could not answer, because Mabel
never did know where any of her belongings
were. Thereupon, Jean, Marjory and
Mabel began a frantic search for the missing
article. Mabel had used it the week
previously; but could remember nothing
more about it.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" groaned Mabel, groveling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
under the spare-room bed in hopes that the
hook might be there. "If I'd dreamed that
my child's life was going to depend on that
hook, I'd have kept it locked up in father's
fire-proof safe."</p>

<p>"That's what you get," said Marjory,
with one eye glued to the top of a very tall
vase, "for being so careless. It isn't in
here, anyway."</p>

<p>"Here's one," announced Bettie, scrambling
in hastily and locking the door behind
her. "I skipped home for it. But there's
no time to lose. All our mothers and Aunty
Jane are going out of Mrs. Mapes's gate
with their best hats and gloves on. There's
something doing!"</p>

<p>In another moment, the cellar door was
closed, a rocking chair was placed upon it,
and Mabel, with ball of yarn and crochet
hook in hand, was nervously twitching in
the chair. Her fingers were stiff with dust&mdash;there
had been no time to wash them&mdash;so
the loop that she tied in the end of the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
yarn was most decidedly black; but Mabel
was thankful to achieve a loop of any color,
with her whole body quivering with excitement
and suspense.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" she quavered. "That
soldier lady was a wonder! Think of her
looking calm outside with her heart going
like a Dover egg-beater. Do&mdash;do <i>I</i> look
calm?"</p>

<p>"Here," said Bettie, extending a basin of
warm water. "Soak your hands in this.
Warm water is said to be soothing."</p>

<p>"Also cleansing," giggled Marjory.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" gasped quick-eared Jean,
snatching the basin and hurling a towel in
Mabel's direction. "I heard our gate click.
There's somebody coming."</p>

<p>"Don't let 'em in," breathed Mabel,
defiantly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said Jean, "we'll have to."</p>

<p>"Anyway," soothed Bettie, "we'll peek
first&mdash;there's the door-bell!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>A Surprise</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>JEAN and Bettie flew to one window,
Marjory to the other. Mabel wanted to
fly, too, but she remained faithfully at her
post, feeling quite cheered by her own
heroism.</p>

<p>"It's dark gray trousers with a crease in
'em; not skirts," announced Marjory, peering
under the edge of the shade.</p>

<p>"Probably a man from the asylum,"
shuddered Bettie. "Let's keep very still.
He may think that this is the wrong house
and go somewhere else."</p>

<p>"But," objected Jean, "he'll only come
back again."</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed Bettie. "I s'pose we will
have to open the door. You do it, Marjory."</p>

<p>"I don't want to," returned Marjory, unexpectedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
shrinking. "It seems too much
like giving Rosa Marie into the hands of the
enemy. After all, we're going to miss her
dreadfully and Mabel'll be just about broken-hearted.
She <i>does</i> get so attached to things&mdash;Oh!
He's ringing again."</p>

<p>"We'll have to unlock the door," sighed
Jean, placing her hand on the key, "but
dearie me, I feel just as Marjory does about
it. Knit fast, Mabel."</p>

<p>The key turned in the lock, but the girls
did not need to open the door; the visitor did
that. Then there were rapturous cries of
"Mr. Black! Mr. Black!"</p>

<p>Mabel wanted to greet Mr. Black, too, for
there was nobody in the world that was
kinder to little girls than the stout gentleman
who had just opened their door; but
she remembered that the soldier lady (in
spite of the Dover egg-beater heart) had
remained seated, placidly knitting; so Mabel
likewise sat still and plied her crochet hook.</p>

<p>"Hi, hi!" exclaimed Mr. Black. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
are you all locked in for? And here I had
to ring four times when I came with a
present&mdash;apples right off the top of my own
barrel. Began to be afraid I'd have to eat
them all myself, you were so long letting
me in."</p>

<p>"If we'd guessed that it was you and
apples," said Marjory, "we'd have met you
at the gate."</p>

<p>"Where's the other girl?" asked Mr.
Black's big, cheery voice. "Doesn't she
like apples, too?"</p>

<p>"In the kitchen," chorused Jean, Marjory
and Bettie.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" said Mr. Black, striding
kitchenward, "here she is, knitting like
any old lady. Aren't you coming in here to
eat apples with the rest of us?"</p>

<p>"Can't," mumbled Mabel.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, grandma?" teased
Mr. Black. "Rheumatism troubling you
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Nope," returned Mabel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lost all your teeth?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"Are you knitting me a pair of socks or
is it mittens?"</p>

<p>"Just a chain," replied Mabel, suddenly
beaming. "But, Mr. Black, does it really
look as if I were knitting?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," smiled Mr. Black. "So
much so that you remind me of the story of
the woman who sat on the trap door and
knitted&mdash;By Jove! That <i>is</i> a trap door!
Here's the ring sticking up."</p>

<p>The girls shot a quick glance at the floor.
Then they gazed guiltily at one another.
Sure enough! The tell-tale ring stood upright,
ready for use. No one had thought
to conceal it.</p>

<p>"Is there a wounded soldier down
there?" asked Mr. Black, jokingly.</p>

<p>"No!" shouted all four with suspicious
haste.</p>

<p>The deep silence that followed was suddenly
punctuated by a muffled sneeze from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Rosa Marie. Undoubtedly, some of the
pepper dislodged from the crack in the floor
had sifted down to the prisoner.</p>

<p>The faces of the four girls flushed guiltily.
Mr. Black looked wonderingly at the
little group. It was plain that something
was wrong. Jean, who had always met her
friend's glance with level, truthful eyes, was
now looking most sheepishly at her own
toes. Bettie, hitherto always ready to tell
the whole truth, was now fiddling evasively
with the corner of her apron. Marjory's
fair skin was crimson; her usually frank
blue eyes were intent on something under
the kitchen table.</p>

<p>"Is there some sort of an animal in that
cellar?" demanded Mr. Black.</p>

<p>Rosa Marie chose this moment to give
another large sneeze.</p>

<p>"Is it something you're afraid of?" demanded
Mr. Black.</p>

<p>"'Fraid of losing," mumbled Mabel,
shamefacedly. Poor Mabel realized only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
too well that she, with her knitting and her
too-perfect playing of the part, had given the
secret away; and she felt all the bitterness
of failure.</p>

<p>Seizing the back of Mabel's chair, Mr.
Black drew it swiftly off the trap door. In
another moment, he had the door open.</p>

<p>Rosa Marie, blinking at the sudden light,
bobbed upward. Mr. Black involuntarily
started back from the opening.</p>

<p>"What under heavens is that!" he
gasped. "A monkey?"</p>

<p>And, indeed, the error was a perfectly
natural one, for all he had been able to see
was a tousled head of hair, beneath which
gleamed small black eyes.</p>

<p>"I should say not!" blazed Mabel. "It's
my little girl&mdash;my Rosa Marie."</p>

<p>"Does she bite? Is she dangerous? Is
that why you treat her like potatoes?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly not," returned Mabel,
with dignity. "She's an Indian."</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Mr. Black, leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
cautiously forward. "Let's have a look
at her."</p>

<p>Now that the secret was out, everybody
eagerly clutched some portion of Rosa
Marie's clothing. She was drawn, with
some difficulty and sundry tearings of cloth,
from the "Soldier's Retreat." Mabel cuddled
the blinking small person in her lap.</p>

<p>"Did you pick her up in the woods?"
asked Mr. Black, "or did you simply kidnap
her? Or, dreadful thought! Did you
order her by number from some catalogue?
And did they charge you full price?"</p>

<p>Then Mabel, helped by the other three,
told all that they knew of the history of
Rosa Marie; and of Mabel's affection for
the queer brown baby. They told him
everything. Mabel, with visions of the
orphan asylum's doors yawning to engulf
precious Rosa Marie, considered it a very
sad story. She felt grieved and indignant
because Mr. Black, instead of sympathizing,
laughed until his sides shook. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
pathetic diet of liver, codfish and prunes
seemed to amuse him.</p>

<p>"What would you have said if your
mothers had asked you where this child
was?" inquired Mr. Black presently. "I
mean, when you had her down cellar?"</p>

<p>Jean looked at Bettie, Bettie looked at
Marjory, Marjory looked at Mabel.</p>

<p>"We never thought of that," confessed
Bettie.</p>

<p>"Oh," groaned Mabel, holding Rosa
Marie closer, "our plan isn't any good after
all. We'd have to tell the truth if they
asked; we always do."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jean, "they'd get it out of us
at once."</p>

<p>"Even," teased Marjory, shrewdly, "if
Mabel, sitting upon that trap door, were not
every bit as good as a printed sign."</p>

<p>"Never mind," soothed Jean, slipping an
arm about Mabel's shoulders, "we'd rather
be honest than smart, since we can't be
both."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel needed soothing. She sat still and
made no sound; but large tears were rolling
down her cheeks and splashing on Rosa
Marie's black head. Mr. Black regarded
them thoughtfully. He noticed too that
Mabel's moderately white hand was closed
tightly over Rosa Marie's brown fingers.
It reminded him, some way, of his own
youthful agony over parting with a puppy
that he had not been allowed to keep&mdash;he
had always regretted that puppy.</p>

<p>Suddenly the front door, propelled by
some unseen force, opened from without to
admit the three mothers and Aunty Jane,
followed closely by Mr. Tucker, Dr. Bennett
and two young women in nurses' uniform.
They crowded into the little parlor
and filled it to overflowing. None of the
Cottagers said a word; but Mabel, tears still
rolling down her cheeks, silently clasped
both arms tightly about Rosa Marie's body.
It began to look as if Rosa Marie would
have to be taken by force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all arranged," announced Mrs. Bennett,
breathlessly. "The asylum is willing
to take her and she is to go at once with
these young ladies. Come, Mabel, don't be
foolish. Take your arms away. You're
behaving very badly&mdash;There, there, I'll buy
you something."</p>

<p>"You're just a little too late," said Mr.
Black, keeping watchful eyes on Mabel's
speaking countenance. "I've decided to
take the responsibility of Rosa Marie into
my own hands."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>Breaking the News</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>WHEN Mr. Black went home that afternoon
to explain the matter to his
good sister, Mrs. Crane, he took with him
not only Rosa Marie, but Jean, Marjory,
Bettie and Mabel, whose parents had given
them permission to escort the brown baby
to her new home.</p>

<p>"You see," said he, while waiting for
Rosa Marie to be made somewhat more attractive,
"I want you to tell the story to
Mrs. Crane, precisely as you told it to me.
But don't mention <i>me</i> until you get to the
very end."</p>

<p>With her hair brushed and braided and
her fat little body stuffed into a pink gingham
apron that the Cottagers had laboriously
cut down from a wrapper of Mrs.
Halliday's, Rosa Marie looked her best, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
spite of the fact that she wore no shoes and
stockings. She trotted contentedly at
Mabel's side; but Bettie, who was supposed
to be walking with Mr. Black, pranced delightedly
about him in circles, to show her
gratitude. Jean and Marjory followed more
sedately but with beaming countenances.</p>

<p>Now that Mrs. Crane was no longer poor,
she was always dressed very neatly in black
silk. Except for that she was precisely the
same jolly, good-natured woman that she
had been when she lived alone in the little
house just across the street from Dandelion
Cottage. Now, however, she lived with her
brother, Mr. Black, in his big, imposing, but
rather gloomy house. She had no husband,
he had no wife and neither had any children.
Perhaps that is why they were both so fond
of the Dandelion Cottagers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crane was planting bulbs in the garden
when Mr. Black ushered his procession
in at the gate.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" said she, "here you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
just in time to help. I always said that if
ever I got a chance to plant all the tulip
bulbs I wanted, I'd die of pure happiness;
but I guess I stand <i>more</i> chance of dying of
a broken back. My land! I've planted two
thousand three hundred and forty-eight of
the best-looking bulbs I ever laid eyes on,
and there ain't a hole in those boxes yet.
They're all named, too. Here's Rachel
Ruish, Rose Grisdelin, Rosy Mundi, Yellow
Prince, the Duke of York&mdash;think of having
<i>him</i> in your front yard&mdash;and Lady Grandison,
two inches apart, clear to the gate. But
land! I suppose a body's tongue'd go lame
counting <i>diamonds</i>."</p>

<p>"Why don't you let Martin plant them?"
asked Mr. Black, with a twinkle in his eye.
It was plain that he enjoyed his talkative
elderly sister.</p>

<p>"And have them all bloom in China?"
retorted Mrs. Crane. "Now you know,
Peter, that Martin couldn't get a bulb right
end up if there were printed directions on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the skin of every bulb. But Jean there, and
Bettie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll do it," cried the girls. "Just tell
us how."</p>

<p>"Two inches apart, pointed end up, all
the way along those little trenches," directed
Mrs. Crane, seating herself in the wheelbarrow.
"No, not <i>you</i>, Mabel. You and
Martin&mdash;Well, I won't <i>say</i> it. Why!
What's the matter with your face? Looks
to me as if you'd dusted the coal bin with
yourself and then cried about it. What's
the trouble?"</p>

<p>Thereupon Mabel introduced Rosa Marie,
who had been shyly hiding behind a rosebush,
told her story and graphically described
the horrors of the orphan asylum.</p>

<p>"While I don't believe that any orphan
asylum is as black as you've painted that
one," said Mrs. Crane, "it does seem a pity
to shut a little outdoor animal like that up
in a cage when she ain't used to it. Now,
Peter, you listen to me. Why couldn't <i>we</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
keep Rosa Marie here for a time. Like
enough, her mother'll be back after her most
any day. In the meantime, she'd be more
company than a cat and easier to wash than
a poodle."</p>

<p>"Well now, I don't know," returned Mr.
Black, winking at Mabel. "A child is a
great deal of trouble."</p>

<p>"Shame on you, Peter Black. It's only
yesterday that you bought a wretched old
horse to keep his owner from ill-treating
him; and here you are refusing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, not exactly refusing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Begrudging, anyway, to rescue that innocent
lamb&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She means black sheep," whispered
Marjory, into Jean's convenient ear.</p>

<p>"From that institution. Peter Black!
I'm just going to keep that child, anyway."</p>

<p>At this, all five laughed merrily. Rosa
Marie, cheered by the sound, reached
gravely into a paper bag, gravely handed
each person a tulip bulb and appropriated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
one herself. She took a generous bite out
of hers.</p>

<p>"We'll plant 'em in a ring around that
snowball bush," said Mrs. Crane, rescuing
the bitten bulb, bite and all. "That shall be
Rosa Marie's own flower bed."</p>

<p>"There's a nursery on the second floor,"
said Mr. Black. "You girls must help us
fix it up. And, Mabel, perhaps <i>you</i> would
like to spend this money for some toys that
would just exactly suit Rosa Marie."</p>

<p>Mabel beamed gratefully as she accepted
the money and the responsibility. Never
before had any one singled her out to perform
a task that required discretion. It was
always Jean, or Bettie, or sometimes even
Marjory that was chosen. Never before
had greatness been thrust upon Mabel. She
lavished grateful, affectionate glances on
Mr. Black and inwardly determined to save
part of the cash with which to buy him a
Christmas present, not realizing that that
would be a misappropriation of funds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel, however, felt a pang of jealousy
when Rosa Marie, digging contentedly in
the sand at Mrs. Crane's feet, allowed her
former guardian to depart absolutely unnoticed.</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> think," confided Mabel to Bettie,
who walked beside her, "that she'd at least
<i>look</i> as if she cared."</p>

<p>That night the mothers made peace with
their daughters, and Aunty Jane extended a
flag of truce to Marjory.</p>

<p>"It was all for your own good," explained
Mrs. Bennett, her arm about Mabel, who
was missing the pleasant task of putting
Rosa Marie to bed. "I couldn't let you
grow up with a little Indian continually at
your heels. You'd have grown tired of her,
too. And by keeping silence so long, you
did a great deal of harm. If we'd known
about the matter at once, we might have been
able to find her mother. Now it's too late."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said Mabel,
contritely. "I'll tell right away, next time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mabel! There mustn't <i>be</i> a next time.
Promise me this instant that you'll never
borrow another baby unless you know
that its mother really wants to keep it.
Promise."</p>

<p>"All right, I promise," said Mabel,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"But I <i>can't</i> think," remarked Mrs. Bennett,
"what possessed Mr. Black to be so
foolish as to take such a child into his own
home."</p>

<p>There were other persons that wondered,
too, why Mr. Black should burden his household
with the care of what Martin, his man,
called an uncivilized savage; but the truth
of the matter was just this. The large
silent tears rolling down Mabel's forlorn
countenance had suddenly proved too much
for the tender heart of Mr. Black. In some
ways, perhaps, impulsive Mr. Black was not
a wise man; but, where children were concerned,
there was no doubt of his being an
exceedingly tender person.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>The Alarm</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>NOW that the burden of caring for Rosa
Marie was shifted to older and more
competent shoulders, the Cottagers' thoughts
returned to their school-work. It was time.
Never had lessons been so neglected. Never
before had four moderately intelligent little
girls seemed so stupid. But of course
with their minds filled with Rosa Marie, it
had been impossible to keep the rivers of
South America from lightmindedly running
over into Asia, or the products of British
Columbia from being exported from
Calcutta.</p>

<p>These fortunate girls attended a beautiful
school. That is, the building was beautiful.
It stood right in the middle of a great big
grassy block, entirely surrounded, as Bettie
put it, by street, which of course added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
greatly to its dignity. It was built of "raindrop"
sandstone, a most interesting building
material because no two blocks were
alike and also because each stone looked as
if it had just been sprinkled with big, spattering
drops of rain. It was hard when
looking at it to believe that it wasn't raining,
and certain naughty youngsters delighted
in fooling new teachers by pointing
out the deceiving drops that flecked the
balustrade. Perhaps even the grass was
fooled by this semblance to showers for, in
summer time, it grew so thriftily that no
one had to be warned to "Keep off," so a
great many little people frolicked in the
schoolyard even during vacation.</p>

<p>Of course the Dandelion Cottagers were
not in the same classes in school. Jean,
being the oldest, the most sedate and the
most studious, was almost through the
eighth grade. Marjory, being naturally
very bright and also moderately industrious,
was in the seventh. Mabel and Bettie were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
not exactly anywhere. You see, Bettie had
had to stay out so often to keep the next to
the youngest Tucker baby from falling
downstairs, that naturally she had dropped
behind all the classes that she had ever
started with; and Mabel&mdash;of course Mabel
<i>meant</i> well, but when she studied at all it
was usually the lesson for some other day;
for this blundering maiden never <i>could</i> remember
which was the right page. But one
day she happened by some lucky accident to
stumble upon the right one, and on that
solitary occasion she recited so very brilliantly
that Miss Bonner and all the pupils
dropped their books to listen in astonishment,
and Mabel was marked one hundred.</p>

<p>But in spite of this high mark in good
black ink (if one stood less than seventy-five
red ink was employed) the thing did not
happen again that fall because Mabel was
too busy bringing up Rosa Marie to study
even the wrong lesson. However, she was
exceedingly fond of pretty Miss Bonner and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
having learned the exact date of that young
woman's birthday, hoped to appease her by
a gift to be paid for by contributions from
all the pupils in Miss Bonner's room. Mabel
herself received and cared for the slowly accumulating
funds, and the little brown purse
was becoming almost as weighty a responsibility
as Rosa Marie had been. Sometimes
it rested in Mabel's untrustworthy pocket,
sometimes in her rather untidy desk, sometimes
under her pillow in her own room at
home. One day Mrs. Bennett found it
there.</p>

<p>"Why, Mabel!" she exclaimed. "Where
did all this money come from? I know <i>you</i>
don't possess any."</p>

<p>"It's the M. B. B. P. F.," responded
Mabel, who was brushing her hair with
evident enjoyment and two very handsome
military brushes. "I guess I'd better put
it in my pocket."</p>

<p>"The what?" asked puzzled Mrs.
Bennett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Miss Bonner Birthday Present
Fund. I'm the Cus&mdash;Cus&mdash;Custodium."</p>

<p>"The what kind of cuss?" asked Dr.
Bennett, who had just poked his head in at
the door to ask if, by any chance, Mabel had
seen anything of his hair brushes.</p>

<p>"The Custodium," replied Mabel, with
dignity.</p>

<p>"I think she means 'Custodian.'" explained
Mrs. Bennett, rescuing the brushes.</p>

<p>"Well," retorted Mabel, "the toad part
was all right if the tail wasn't. Marjory
named me that, and she's always using bigger
words than she ought to."</p>

<p>"So is somebody else," said Dr. Bennett,
forgetting to scold about the brushes. "But
I think the 'Custodium' had better hurry,
or she'll be late for school."</p>

<p>That was Friday, and the little brown
purse contained two dollars and forty-seven
cents, which seemed a tremendous sum to inexperienced
Mabel.</p>

<p>She remembered afterwards how very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
big, imposing and substantial the school
building had looked that morning as she approached
it and noticed some strangers fingering
the "rain-drops" to see if they were
real. Indeed, everybody, from the largest
tax-payer down to the smallest pupil, was
proud of that building because it was so big
and because there was no more rain-drop
sandstone left in the quarry from which it
had been taken. Even thoughtless Mabel
always swelled with pride when tourists
paused to comment on the queer, spotted appearance
of those massive walls. She meant
to point that building out some day to her
grandchildren as the fount of all her learning;
for the huge, solid building looked as
if it would certainly outlast not only Mabel's
grandchildren but all their great-great-grandchildren
as well. But it didn't.</p>

<p>The catastrophe came on Saturday.
Afterwards, everybody in Lakeville was
glad, since the thing had to happen at all,
that the day was Saturday, for no one liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to think what might have happened had the
trouble come on a schoolday. It was also
a Saturday in the first week of November,
which was not quite so fortunate, as there
was a stiff north wind.</p>

<p>At two o'clock that afternoon the streets
were almost deserted, but weatherproof
Dick Tucker, with his hands in his pockets,
was going along whistling at the top of his
very good lungs. By the merest chance he
glanced at the wide windows of Lakeville's
most pretentious possession, the big Public
School building.</p>

<p>From four of the upper windows floated
thin, softly curling plumes of gray smoke.
The windows were closed, but the smoke appeared
to be leaking out from the surrounding
frames.</p>

<p>"Hello!" muttered Dick, suddenly shutting
off his whistle. "That looks like
smoke. The janitor must be rebuilding the
furnace fire. But why should smoke&mdash;I
guess I'll investigate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The puzzled boy ran up the steps, pulled
the vestibule door open and eagerly pressed
his nose against the plate-glass panel of the
inner door, which was locked. Through the
glass, however, he could plainly see that the
wide corridor was thick with smoke. He
could even smell it.</p>

<p>"Great guns!" exclaimed Dick. "There's
things doing in there! That furnace never
smokes as hard as all that and besides the
Janitor always has Saturday afternoons off.
Perhaps the basement door is unlocked."</p>

<p>Dick ran down the steps to find that door,
too, securely fastened.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Dick, with another look
at the curling smoke about the upper windows,
"the thing for me to do is to turn in
an alarm."</p>

<p>Dick happened to know where the alarm-box
was situated, so, feeling most important,
yet withal strangely shaky as to legs, the lad
made for the corner, a good long block
distant, smashed the glass according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
directions, and sent in the alarm, a thing that
he had always longed to do.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the big red hosecart,
with gong ringing, firemen shouting and
dogs barking, was dashing up the street.
The hook and ladder company followed and
a meat wagon, or rather a meat-wagon horse,
galloped after. The foundry whistle began
to give the ward number in long, melancholy,
terrifying toots and the hosehouse bell
joined in with a mad clamor. People
poured from the houses along the hosecart's
route, for in Lakeville it was customary for
private citizens to attend all fires.</p>

<p>Dick, feeling most important, stood on
the schoolhouse steps and pointed upward.
The hosecart stopped with a jerk that must
have surprised the horses, firemen leaped
down and in a twinkling the foremost had
smashed in the big glass door.</p>

<p>"It's a fire all right," said he.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Janitor, chopping wood in
his own backyard (which was his way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
enjoying his afternoons off), had listened
intently to the fire alarm.</p>

<p>"Six-Two," said he, suddenly dropping
his ax. "Guess I'll have a look at that fire.
That's pretty close to my school."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>The Fire</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>JEAN, Bettie, Marjory and Mabel ran with
the rest to see what was happening, for
their homes were not far from the schoolhouse.
Indeed, owing to its ample setting,
the building was plainly visible from all
directions; and from a distance, it always
loomed larger than anything else in the
town. To all the citizens it was a most unusual
and alarming sight to see thick, black
smoke curling about the eaves and rising in
a threatening column above the familiar
building. Such a thing had never happened
before.</p>

<p>Marjory was the first of the quartette to
discover what was going on. She had
opened her bedroom window the better to
count the strokes of the fire-bell when, to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
astonishment, she saw the fire itself or at
least the smoke thereof. Her first thought
was of her three friends; for of course no
Cottager could view such a spectacle as this
promised to be without the companionship
of the other three.</p>

<p>So Marjory flew around the block&mdash;like
a little excited hen, Dr. Tucker said&mdash;and
collected the girls. They ran in a body to
join the swelling crowd that surrounded the
smoking building.</p>

<p>"Keep back out of danger," called Aunty
Jane, who was watching the fire from her
upstairs window.</p>

<p>"We will," shrieked Marjory, who, with
the other three, was rushing by.</p>

<p>"Don't get mixed up with the hose,"
warned Dr. Tucker, who was carrying young
Peter to view the fire.</p>

<p>"We won't," promised Bettie. "We'll
stand on the very safest corner."</p>

<p>"This is it," declared Jean, stopping short
on the sidewalk. "We can see right over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the heads of the folks that are close to the
building."</p>

<p>"Should you think," panted Mabel, hopefully,
"that there'd be school Monday?"</p>

<p>"Looks doubtful," said Marjory.</p>

<p>"Not upstairs, anyway," returned Jean.
"Everything must be smoked perfectly
black. And it's getting worse every minute
instead of better."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" cried Mabel, suddenly turning
pale at a new and alarming thought.
"I do hope it won't burn <i>my</i> room. The
money for Miss Bonner's birthday present
is in my desk. It's&mdash;it's a horrible lot of
money to lose. I ought never to have left
it there. Dear me! Do you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Phew!" cried Jean, paying no heed to
Mabel. "Look at that!"</p>

<p>"That" was a terrifying flash of red that
suddenly illumined six of the big upper
windows.</p>

<p>"The High School room," groaned Bettie.
"It's&mdash;it's <i>flames</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hang it!" growled an indignant tax-payer.
"Why doesn't somebody <i>do</i> something?
That building cost fifty thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"Fire started from a defective flue on top
floor," explained another bystander, "but
that's no reason why the whole place should
go. There's no fire downstairs, but there
<i>will</i> be&mdash;What's that? No water? Broken
hydrant?"</p>

<p>Mabel listened attentively. The bystander
continued:</p>

<p>"Then the whole building is doomed.
It's had time enough to get a tremendous
start."</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" cried Jean. "It's bursting
through into the next room&mdash;<i>my</i> room!
Oh, how <i>dreadful</i>! All our plants, our
books, our pictures&mdash;Oh, oh! I can't bear
to look."</p>

<p>Firemen and volunteer helpers were,
hurrying in and out the wide south door.
Men carried out towering piles of books and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
tossed them ruthlessly to the ground. Miss
Bonner's big pink geranium was added to
the heap. The Janitor appeared with the
big hall clock, that wouldn't go at all on
ordinary occasions but was now striking
seven hundred and twenty-seven&mdash;or something
like that&mdash;all at one stretch. It
seemed to be crying out in alarm. The roar
of flames could now be heard, likewise.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Jean, wheeling suddenly.
"Where's Mabel? Wasn't she
right beside you a minute ago, Bettie? I
certainly saw her there."</p>

<p>"She was&mdash;but she isn't now," returned
Bettie, looking about anxiously. "I
thought she was behind me."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" murmured motherly Jean.
"I hope she hasn't gone any closer. Suppose
the scallops on that roof should begin
to melt off."</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" cried Marjory. "There!
In the doorway!"</p>

<p>All three looked just in time to see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
short, not-very-slender girl in an unmistakable
red cap dart in at the smoky doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh," groaned Jean, "it's Mabel!"</p>

<p>"Oh," moaned Marjory, "why did I ever
tell her that there was a fire?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," hazarded Bettie, "that
she's gone to Miss Bonner's room to get that
money."</p>

<p>Bettie was right. That was exactly what
Mabel had done.</p>

<p>All along Mabel's way hands had
stretched out to stop the flying figure. But
the hands were always just a little too late.
You see, the owners of the tardy hands did
not realize quickly enough that rash little
Mabel actually meant to enter a building
whose top floor was all in flames. She was
fairly inside before the onlookers grasped
the situation.</p>

<p>"How perfectly foolish!" cried Marjory,
stamping her foot in helpless rage. "Of
course somebody'll get her out&mdash;there's two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
men going in now&mdash;but how perfectly silly
for her to go in at all!"</p>

<p>Mabel, however, was not feeling at all
foolish. No, indeed. The little girl, to her
own way of thinking, was doing a worthy,
even a heroic, deed. She was rescuing the
precious two dollars and forty-seven cents
that her class had so laboriously raised to
buy Miss Bonner a birthday gift. She
would have liked to accomplish it in a little
less spectacular manner, but, no other way
being available, she had made the best of circumstances
and was ignoring the crowd.
She hoped, indeed, that no one had noticed
her; with so much else to look at it seemed
as if one small girl might easily remain unobserved.
To be sure she was risking her
life, the life of the only little girl that her
parents possessed; but that seemed a small
affair beside two dollars and forty-seven
cents. The roof might fall, the cornice
might drop, the huge chimney might collapse,
the suffocating smoke or scorching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
flames might suddenly pour into that still
unburned lower room. Let them! Heroes
never stopped for such trifles with such a
sum at stake.</p>

<p>By this time, Jean, Marjory and Bettie
were white and absolutely speechless with
fear. Four firemen were sitting on Dr.
Bennett to keep him from rushing in after
the little girl he had promptly recognized as
his own, and five women were supporting
and encouraging Mrs. Bennett, who had
grown too weak to stand although she still
had her wits about her.</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars reward," Mr. Black was
shouting, "to the man that gets that child!"</p>

<p>He would have gone after her himself,
but Mrs. Crane had him firmly by the coat-tails
and both Dr. and Mrs. Tucker were
clinging to his arms.</p>

<p>"Be aisy, be aisy," Mrs. Malony, the egg-woman
was murmuring to the world in
general. "Miss Mabel's the kind thot's always
escapin' jist be the skin av her teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Rest aisy. Thim fire-laddies'll be havin'
her out av thot dure in another jiffy."</p>

<p>But, although the crowd rested as "aisy"
as it could, the moments went by and no
Mabel appeared.</p>

<p>With every instant the fire grew worse.
By this time, the smoke and angry sheets of
flame had burst through the roof and were
streaming, with a mighty, threatening roar,
straight up into the blackened sky&mdash;a splendid
sight that was visible for a long distance.
There was no water to check the mighty
fire, for, a very few moments after the hose
had been attached, the hydrant had burst and
the water that should have been busy quenching
the fire was quietly drenching the feet
of many an unheeding bystander.</p>

<p>And presently the thing that everybody
expected happened. With a lingering, horrible
crash a large part of the upper floor
dropped to the main hall below. Smoke
poured from the lower doors and windows.
In another moment leaping hungry flames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
were visible in every room except the basement.
The entire superstructure seemed
now just like a gigantic, topless furnace;
and of course it was no longer possible for
even the firemen to venture inside.</p>

<p>But <i>where</i> was Mabel?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>A Heroine's Come-Down</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>MABEL, with the Janitor and four pursuing
firemen at her reckless heels,
had made a bold dash through the long corridor
that led to Miss Bonner's room. Owing
to a strong upward draft, there was
surprisingly little smoke in this corridor and
none at all in Miss Bonner's distant corner.</p>

<p>Still hotly pursued, Mabel, who had the
advantage of knowing exactly whither she
was bound, darted down the narrow aisle,
reached into her desk, and, unselfishly passing
by sundry dearly loved treasures of her
own, seized the fat brown purse. Such joy
to find it when so many of the desks had
been stripped of their contents!</p>

<p>She was none too soon, for the next moment
the Janitor's hands had closed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
her and, plump as she was, the sturdy fellow
easily carried her out of the room, although
Mabel protested crossly that she would
much rather walk. In this uncomfortable
fashion they reached the corridor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i0132.jpg" width="310" height="500" alt="Man carrying girl under his arm" />
<div class="caption">THE STURDY FELLOW CARRIED HER OUT OF THE ROOM.</div>
</div>

<p>"Not that way&mdash;not that way!" shouted
the firemen, pointing towards a glowing,
spreading patch on the ceiling of the main
hall. "It's breaking through&mdash;you can't
reach the door! It's not safe at that end."</p>

<p>"Down to the basement!" shouted the
Janitor, nodding toward a narrow doorway,
through which the men promptly vanished.</p>

<p>Then, seemingly, a new thought assailed
the Janitor.</p>

<p>"Open door number twelve," he shouted
after the men.</p>

<p>Then, hurriedly pushing up a sliding door
at the safest end of the hall and murmuring
"Quicker this way," the Janitor unceremoniously
lifted Mabel and dropped her
down the big dust-chute.</p>

<p>What a place for a heroine! In spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
her surprise, Mabel felt deeply mortified. It
was humiliating enough for a would-be
rescuer to be rescued; but to be dropped
down a horrid, stuffy dust-chute and to land
with a queer, springy thud on a pile of sliding
stuff&mdash;the contents of a dozen or more
waste-baskets and the results of innumerable
sweepings&mdash;was worse.</p>

<p>In a very few seconds, the hasty Janitor
had opened the lower door of the chute and,
with the firemen standing by, was calmly
hauling her out by her feet&mdash;Oh! She could
<i>never</i> tell that part of it.</p>

<p>And then, as if that were not bad enough,
that inconsiderate Janitor seized her by the
elbow and hurried her right into the coal bin,
forced her to march over eighty tons of
black, dusty, sliding coal and finally compelled
her to crawl&mdash;yes, <i>crawl</i>&mdash;out of a
small basement window on the safest side of
the building. The only explanation that the
rescuer vouchsafed was a gruff statement
that the fire was "More to the other end"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and that short-cuts saved time. Mabel tried
to tell him what <i>she</i> thought about it, but the
Janitor seemed too excited to listen.</p>

<p>Of course, by this time, the Bennetts, the
Cottagers, the firemen, the Janitor's wife
and most of the bystanders were in a perfectly
dreadful state of mind; for the coal-hole
window was not on their side of the
building&mdash;Mabel was glad of that&mdash;so none
of her friends witnessed her exit. The
Cottagers, in particular, were clutching each
other and fairly quaking with fear when a
familiar voice behind them panted breathlessly:</p>

<p>"I saved it, girls."</p>

<p>Jean, Marjory and Bettie wheeled as one
girl. It was certainly Mabel's voice, the
shape and size were Mabel's, but the
color&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Jean, in a horrified tone.
"Are you <i>burned</i>? Are you all burned up
to a crisp?"</p>

<p>But thoughtful Bettie, after one searching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
look to make certain that it really was
Mabel, had not stopped to ask questions,
nor to hear them answered. She remembered
that the Bennetts were still anxious
concerning their missing daughter, and
straightway flew to relieve their minds.</p>

<p>"She's safe, Mabel's safe," she shouted,
running to the Bennetts, to Mr. Black, to
the Tuckers, to all Mabel's friends, and completely
forgetting her own usual shyness.
"Yes, she's all safe. No, not burned; just
scorched, I guess."</p>

<p>Then everybody crowded around Mabel.
Mrs. Bennett was about to kiss her, but
desisted just in time.</p>

<p>"Mabel!" she cried, as Jean had done.
"Are you burned?"</p>

<p>"No," mumbled Mabel, indignantly.
"I'm not even singed. I&mdash;I just came out
through the coal hole, but you needn't tell.
That horrid Janitor dragged me out over a
whole mountain of coal."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" breathed Mrs. Bennett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh!" snorted Mabel, "that's a mighty
queer thing to thank Heaven for, when it was
only last night that I had a perfectly good
bath. That's the meanest Janitor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded Dr. Bennett,
eagerly. "I must thank him."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Bennett, "I must thank
him too."</p>

<p>"And I," said Dr. Tucker, "should like
to shake hands with him."</p>

<p>And would you believe it! Not a soul had
a word of praise for Mabel's bravery. Not
a person commended her for saving that
precious purse. Instead, the local paper
devoted a whole column to lauding the
prompt action of that sickening Janitor, Dr.
Bennett gave him a splendid gold watch, the
School Board recommended him for a
Carnegie medal&mdash;all because of the dust-chute.</p>

<p>"Don't let me hear any more," Dr. Bennett
said that night, "about that miserable
two dollars and forty-seven cents. I'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
rather give you two hundred and forty-seven
dollars than have you take such risks."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," rejoined Mabel, meekly.
"But you didn't say anything like that day
before yesterday when I asked for three
more cents to make it an even two-fifty. I
must say I don't understand grown folks."</p>

<p>"Mabel, you go&mdash;go take that bath. And
when you're clean enough to kiss, come back
and say good-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," sighed Mabel, "but I <i>do</i> wish
I <i>could</i> raise three more cents."</p>

<p>Mr. Bennett fished two quarters and three
pennies from his pocket and handed them to
Mabel.</p>

<p>"There," said he, "you have an even
three dollars, but I hope you won't consider
it necessary to rescue them in case of any
more fires."</p>

<p>Fortunately, there were no more fires;
but the original one made up for this lack by
lasting for an astonishing length of time.
For seven days the school building continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to burn in a safe but expensive manner;
for the eighty tons of coal over which
Mabel had walked so unwillingly had caught
fire late in the afternoon and had burned
steadily until entirely reduced to ashes. It
was a strange, uncanny sight after dark to
see the mighty ruin still lighted by a fitful
glare from within. Only the four walls,
the bare outer shell of the huge structure,
remained. You see, all the rest of it had
been wood&mdash;and steam pipes. Every splinter
of wood was gone; but the pipes, and
there seemed to be miles of them, were
twisted like mighty serpents. They filled
the cellar and seemed fairly to writhe in the
scarlet glow. It made one think of dragons
and volcanoes and things like that; and
caused creepy feelings in one's spine.</p>

<p>Even the dust-chute was gone. Mabel
was glad of that. She hated to think of the
Janitor proudly pointing it out to visitors
and saying:</p>

<p>"I once dropped a girl down there."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>A Birthday Party</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>BUT if Mabel derived little joy from
her experience as a heroine, there was
at least some satisfaction in knowing that
there could be no school on Monday, for
Mabel was decidedly partial toward holidays.</p>

<p>"If I ever teach school," she often said,
"there'll be two Saturdays every week and
no afternoon sessions."</p>

<p>Jean, however, really liked to go to school.
So did Marjory, but Bettie was uncertain.</p>

<p>"If," said Bettie, "I could go long
enough to know what grade I belonged in it
might be interesting; but when you only attend
in patches it's sort of mixing. There's
a little piece of me in three different grades."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Crane realized that there
could be no school on Monday, she too was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
pleased. She stopped a moment after
church on Sunday to intercept the girls on
their way to Sunday School.</p>

<p>"My!" said she. "How spruce you
look!"</p>

<p>They did look "spruce." Tall Jean was all
in brown, even to her gloves and overshoes.
Marjory's trim little winter suit was of dark
green broadcloth with gray furs, for neat
Aunty Jane, whatever her other failings, always
kept Marjory very beautifully dressed.
Bettie's short, kilted skirt was red under a
boyish black reefer that had once belonged
to Dick, and a black hat that Bob had discarded
as "too floppy" had been wired and
trimmed with scarlet cloth to match the
skirt. This hand-me-down outfit was very
becoming to dark-eyed Bettie, but then,
Bettie was pretty in anything. Plump
Mabel was buttoned tightly into a navy blue
suit. Although she had owned it for barely
six weeks it was no longer big enough either
lengthwise or sidewise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," said Mabel, cheerfully, "by holding
my breath most of the time I can stand
it for one hour on Sundays."</p>

<p>"How would you like," asked Mrs. Crane,
"to spend to-morrow with me and Rosa
Marie?"</p>

<p>"We'd love to," said Jean.</p>

<p>"We'd like it a lot," said Marjory.</p>

<p>"Just awfully," breathed Bettie.</p>

<p>"Oh, goody!" gurgled Mabel.</p>

<p>"You see," said Mrs. Crane, "I'm not
altogether easy about Rosa Marie. I do
every living thing I can think of, but someway
I can't get inside that child's shell. I
declare, it seems sometimes as if she really
pities me for being so stupid. And I think
she's falling off in her looks."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>hope</i> not," cried Mabel, fervently.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Marjory, "it certainly
wouldn't do for Rosa Marie to fall off very
<i>much</i>."</p>

<p>"However," returned Mrs. Crane, loyally,
"she might be very much worse and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
any rate she is warm and well fed, even if
she does seem a bit&mdash;foreign. So that
Janitor put you down through the dust-chute,
did he, Mabel? You must have
landed with quite a jolt."</p>

<p>"No," returned Mabel, rather sulkily, for
every one was mentioning the dust-chute.
"I had all September's and October's sweepings
to land on. It was all mushy and
springy, like mother's bed."</p>

<p>"How," pursued kindly Mrs. Crane, "did
he get you out?"</p>

<p>"I'd&mdash;I'd rather not say," mumbled
Mabel, flushing a brilliant crimson. No one
else had thought to ask this dreaded question,
and the papers, fortunately, had overlooked
this detail.</p>

<p>"Why!" giggled teasing Marjory, "he
<i>must</i> have dragged her out by her feet because
she's so fat that she couldn't possibly
have turned herself over in that narrow
space. It's just like a chimney, you know.
I've often looked down that place and wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
if Santa Claus could manage the trip
down. Oh, Mabel! It must have been
funny! Tell us about it."</p>

<p>Mabel grinned, but it was rather a sickly
grin.</p>

<p>"First," she said, "he clawed out a lot
of papers and stuff. Ugh! It was horrid
to feel everything sliding right out from under
me&mdash;I didn't know <i>how</i> far I was going
to drop. Then he grabbed my two ankles
and just jerked me out on the bias through
the little door at the bottom. I suppose it
was a lot quicker. But he <i>didn't</i> need to
make me climb all that coal."</p>

<p>"Yes, he did," returned Jean. "The
cornice on the other three sides was all loose
and flopping up and down in the flames.
Pieces kept falling. The coal-bin side was
the last to burn&mdash;the wind went the other
way&mdash;and Miss Bonner's room was the last
to catch fire."</p>

<p>"That Janitor," declared Mrs. Crane,
with conviction, "knew exactly what he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
about. Now, girls, you'll be sure to come
to-morrow, won't you? I think it will do
Rosa Marie good and there's a reason why
I'd like a little company myself, but I shan't
tell you just now what it is."</p>

<p>"Oh, do," begged all four.</p>

<p>"No," returned Mrs. Crane. "It's a
secret, and not a living soul knows it but me.
I'll tell you to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We'll <i>surely</i> come," promised the girls.</p>

<p>Of course they kept their promise. The
four Cottagers arrived very soon after
breakfast, were let in most sedately by Mr.
Black's man, who smiled when the unceremonious
visitors rushed pell-mell past him to
fall upon Mrs. Crane, who was watering
plants in the breakfast room.</p>

<p>"Tell us the secret!" shouted Mabel.
"Oh&mdash;I mean good-morning!"</p>

<p>"Good-morning," smiled Mrs. Crane,
setting the watering pot in a safe place.
"The secret isn't a very big one. It's only
that to-day is my birthday and I thought I'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
like to have a party. You're it. The cook
is making me a birthday cake, but she doesn't
know that it is a birthday cake."</p>

<p>"Goody!" cried Mabel.</p>

<p>"Doesn't Mr. Black know it's your birthday?"
queried Jean.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. You see, it's a long
time since Peter and I spent birthdays under
the same roof, and men don't remember such
things very well. We'll surprise him with
the cake to-night. Now let's go to the
nursery."</p>

<p>Rosa Marie's dull countenance brightened
at sight of her four friends. She gave four
solemn little bobs with her head.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" cried Marjory, "she's learning
manners."</p>

<p>"And see," said Bettie, "she's stringing
beads."</p>

<p>"That's a surprise," said Mrs. Crane,
proudly. "I taught her that."</p>

<p>"Fourteen," said Rosa Marie, unexpectedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Goodness me!" cried Mabel. "Can
she count?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," admitted Mrs. Crane, guardedly,
"but not to depend on. In fact, fourteen
is the only counting word she <i>can</i> say.
Peter taught her that."</p>

<p>"Fourteen," repeated Rosa Marie, holding
up her string of beads.</p>

<p>"You ridiculous baby!" laughed Mabel,
hugging her. "Who are the pretty beads
for?"</p>

<p>Rosa Marie hurriedly clapped the string
about her own brown throat.</p>

<p>"No, no," remonstrated Mrs. Crane.
"You're making them for Mabel."</p>

<p>But Rosa Marie set her small white teeth
firmly together and continued to hold the
beads against her own plump neck.</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> knows whose beads they are,"
laughed Jean.</p>

<p>"I can't teach her a single Christian virtue,"
sighed Mrs. Crane. "There isn't one
unselfish hair in that child's head."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's too young," encouraged Bettie.
"All babies are little savages."</p>

<p>"Not Anne Halliday," said Jean, who
fairly worshiped her small cousin.</p>

<p>"That's different," said Marjory. "Anne
was born with manners."</p>

<p>"The little Tuckers weren't," soothed
Bettie. "Rosa Marie will be generous
enough in time."</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe it," sighed Mrs.
Crane.</p>

<p>"Hi, hi! What's all this racket?" cried
Mr. Black from the doorway. "Is Rosa
Marie doing all that talking? Get your
things on quick, all of you, and come for a
ride with me."</p>

<p>"A ride!" exclaimed Mrs. Crane.
"What in?"</p>

<p>"An automobile," returned Mr. Black,
turning to wink comically at Bettie.</p>

<p>"An automobile!" echoed Mrs. Crane.
"I'd like to know whose. There's only one
in town and I don't know the owners."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yours," twinkled Mr. Black. "It's
your birthday present."</p>

<p>"How did you know that this was the
day?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I remembered," said Mr. Black,
smiling rather tenderly at his old sister.
"You <i>used</i> to have them on this day."</p>

<p>"I do still," beamed Mrs. Crane. "That's
why I invited the girls; they're my birthday
party. But what's this about automobiles?"</p>

<p>"Only one. It's yours."</p>

<p>"Peter Black! I don't believe you."</p>

<p>"Look out the hall window."</p>

<p>Everybody rushed to the big window in
the front hall. Sure enough! A splendid
motor car stood at the gate.</p>

<p>"Peter," faltered Mrs. Crane, "have I
<i>got</i> to ride in that? I've never set foot in
one, and I'm sure I'd be scared to at
this late day."</p>

<p>"What! Not ride in your own automobile?
Bless you, Sarah, in another week
you'll refuse to stay out of it. Get your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
things on, everybody; and warm ones, too.
Find extra wraps for these girls, Sarah.
There's room for everybody but Rosa
Marie."</p>

<p>"Now, isn't that just like a man?" said
Mrs. Crane, looking about helplessly.
"Whose clothes does he think you're going
to wear for 'extra wraps'? His, or
mine?"</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, for obviously Mr.
Black's house was a poor one in which to
find little girls' garments.</p>

<p>"We'll stop at your houses," said he,
"and pick up some duds. Besides, perhaps
your mothers might like to know that you've
been kidnaped. What! no hat on yet?
Here, pin this on," said Mr. Black, handing
Mrs. Crane a pink dust-cap. "I can't wait
all day."</p>

<p>"Mercy! That's not a bonnet," cried
Mrs. Crane, scurrying away. "I'll be ready
in two minutes."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>An Unexpected Treat</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>"PETER," demanded Mrs. Crane, stopping
short on the horse-block, "who's
going to run that thing?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Not with me in it. You don't know
how."</p>

<p>"My dear, I've been learning the business
for five weeks."</p>

<p>"So <i>that's</i> what has taken you to Bancroft
every afternoon for all that time?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what," admitted Mr.
Black.</p>

<p>"And you're <i>sure</i>," queried Mrs. Crane,
doubtfully, "that you understand all those
fixings?"</p>

<p>"Every one of them."</p>

<p>"Will you promise to go slow?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's a fine for exceeding the speed
limit," twinkled Mr. Black.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad of that," said Mrs.
Crane, permitting her patient brother to
help her into the vehicle. "My! but these
cushions are soft."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bettie, "it's just like sitting
on baking powder biscuits before they're
baked."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Mr. Black.</p>

<p>"Because I've tried it. You see, ministers'
wives are dreadfully interrupted persons,
and one night when Mother was making
biscuits some visitors came. Instead of
popping one of the pans into the oven,
mother dropped it on a dining-room chair
on her way to the door and forgot all about
it. When I came in to supper that chair
was at my place and I flopped right down
on those biscuits! And I had to <i>stay</i> sitting
on them because Father had asked one
of the visitors&mdash;<i>such</i> a particular-looking
person&mdash;to stay to tea; and I knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Mother wouldn't want a perfectly strange
man to know about it."</p>

<p>"That was certainly thoughtful," smiled
Mr. Black. "Now, is every one comfortable?
If she is, we'll go for those extra
wraps."</p>

<p>The new machine rolled down the street
and turned the corner in the neatest way
imaginable. Mrs. Crane looked decidedly
uneasy at first; but when Mr. Black had
successfully steered the birthday present
past the ice wagon, a coal team, a prancing
pony and two street cars, she folded the
hands that had been nervously clutching the
side of the car and leaned back with a relieved
sigh.</p>

<p>But when Mabel asked a question, Mrs.
Crane silenced her quickly.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to him," she implored.
"There's no telling <i>what</i> might happen to
us if he were to take any part of his mind off
that&mdash;that helm, for even a single second.
Don't even <i>look</i> at him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>What did happen was this. After the
extra wraps had been collected and donned,
Mr. Black carried his charges all the way to
Bancroft, a distance of seventeen miles, in
perfect safety. The road was good, the day
was mild and the only team they passed
obligingly turned in at its own gate before
they reached it. They stopped in front of
the biggest and best hotel in Bancroft.</p>

<p>"Everybody out for dinner," ordered Mr.
Black.</p>

<p>"But, Peter," expostulated Mrs. Crane,
hanging back, bashfully, "I'm in my every-day
clothes."</p>

<p>"Well, this isn't Sunday; and you always
look well dressed. You're a very neat
woman, Sarah."</p>

<p>"Well I <i>am</i> neat, but black alpaca isn't
silk even if my sleeves <i>are</i> this year's. And
for goodness' sake, Peter, don't ask me to
pronounce any of that bill of fare if it isn't
plain every-day English, for you know there
isn't a French fiber in my tongue. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
order for me. There's only one thing I
can't eat and that's parsnips."</p>

<p>It was a very nice dinner and plain
English enough to suit even matter-of-fact
Mrs. Crane. After the first few bashful
moments, the four girls chattered so merrily
that all the guests at other tables caught
themselves listening and smiling sympathetically.</p>

<p>"I never ate a really truly hotel dinner
before," confided Bettie, happily.</p>

<p>"And to think," sighed Jean, contentedly,
"of doing it without knowing you were
going to! That always makes things
nicer."</p>

<p>"And I <i>never</i> expected to ride in a navy-blue
automobile," murmured Marjory.</p>

<p>"Or to have four kinds of potatoes,"
breathed Mabel, who sat half surrounded by
empty dishes&mdash;"little birds' bath-tubs," she
called them.</p>

<p>"You must be a vegetarian," smiled Mr.
Black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"N-no," denied Mabel. "Only a potatorian."</p>

<p>"Mabel!" objected Marjory. "There
isn't any such word."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," returned Mabel, calmly.
"I just made it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure," sighed Mrs. Crane, "I
never expected to have any such birthday as
this."</p>

<p>"You see," said Mr. Black, giving his sister's
plump elbow a kindly squeeze, "this is
a good many birthdays rolled into one."</p>

<p>"It seems hard," mourned Mabel, who
was earnestly scanning the bill of fare, "to
read about so many kinds of dessert when
you've room enough left for only three. I
wish I'd began saving space sooner."</p>

<p>"You're in luck," laughed Bettie. "A
very small, thin one is all <i>I</i> can manage&mdash;pineapple
ice, I guess."</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Marjory, "I shan't
choose bread pudding. We have that
every Tuesday and Friday at home. Aunty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Jane has regular times for everything, so I
always know just what's coming. I'm
going to have something different&mdash;hot
mince pie, I guess."</p>

<p>"Ice-cream," said Jean, "with hot chocolate
sauce."</p>

<p>"Bring <i>me</i>," said Mabel, turning to the
waiter, "hot mince pie, ice-cream with hot
chocolate sauce and a pineapple ice with
little cakes."</p>

<p>"Bring little cakes for everybody," added
Mr. Black.</p>

<p>"I declare," said Mrs. Crane, "I don't
know when I've been so hungry."</p>

<p>"Now," remarked Mr. Black, half an
hour later, "I think we'd better be jogging
along toward home because it won't be as
warm when the sun goes down and I want
to show you some of the sights in Bancroft&mdash;there's
a pretty good candy shop a few
blocks from here&mdash;before we start toward
Lakeville. We can run down in about an
hour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peter," demanded Mrs. Crane, "what
<i>is</i> that speed limit?"</p>

<p>"About eight miles an hour."</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;and it's seventeen miles&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Sarah, don't go to doing arithmetic&mdash;you
know you were never very good
at it. If I were to keep strictly within that
limit you'd all want to get out and push.
Got all your wraps? Whose muff is this?
Here's a glove. Whose neck belongs to this
pussy-cat thing? Here's a handkerchief and
two more gloves&mdash;Well, well! It's a good
thing you had somebody along to gather up
your duds. What! My hat? Why, that's
so, I <i>did</i> have a cap&mdash;here it is in my coat
pocket."</p>

<p>There was still time after the pleasant ride
home for a good frolic with Rosa Marie and
a cozy meal with Mrs. Crane; strangely
enough, everybody was again hungry enough
to enjoy the big birthday cake and the
good apple-sauce that went with it. Then
Mr. Black carried them all home in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
motor car and delivered each damsel at her
own door. But only one stayed delivered,
for the other three immediately ran around
the block to meet at Jean's always popular
home. You see, they had to talk it all over
without the restraint of their host's presence.</p>

<p>"I think," said Mabel, ecstatically, "that
Mr. Black is just too dear for words. <i>Some</i>
folks are too stingy to live, with their automobiles
and horses and never <i>think</i> of giving
anybody a ride."</p>

<p>"He's certainly very generous," agreed
Jean.</p>

<p>"Of course," ventured Marjory, meditatively,
"he has plenty of money or he
couldn't do nice things."</p>

<p>"He would anyway," declared Bettie.
"It's the way he's made. Don't you remember
how Mrs. Crane was always being
good to people even when she was so dreadfully
poor? Well, Mr. Black would be just
like that, too, even if he hadn't a single dollar.
He has a Santa Claus heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"There <i>are</i> folks," admitted Marjory,
"that wouldn't know how to give anybody a
good time if they had all the money in the
world. There's Aunty Jane, for instance.
She's a <i>very</i> good woman, with a terribly
pricking conscience, and I know she'd like
to make things pleasant for me if she knew
how, but she doesn't, poor thing. She
doesn't know a good time when she sees one.
And Mrs. Howard Slater doesn't, either."</p>

<p>"Good-evening, girls," said Mrs. Mapes,
coming in with a newspaper in her hand.
"I <i>thought</i> I heard voices in here. Have
you had a nice day? You're just in time to
read the paper; there's something in it that
will interest you."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>A Scattered School</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IT seemed too bad for such a delightful
day to end sorrowfully, but the evening
paper certainly brought disquieting news.
It stated that the School Board hoped to
provide, within a very few days, suitable
schoolrooms for all the pupils. And, in
another item, the unfeeling editor complimented
the Board on its enterprise.</p>

<p>"I'd like that Board a whole lot better,"
said Marjory, "if it weren't so enterprising.
I s'posed we were going to have at least a
month to play in."</p>

<p>"Just before Christmas, too," grumbled
Mabel. "They might at least have waited
until I'd finished Father's shoe-bag. And
what do you think? Mother says I'd better
give that Janitor a Christmas present!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the paper is mistaken," soothed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Jean. "You know it always is about the
weather reports. If it says 'Fair,' it's sure
to rain; and when it says 'Colder,' it's quite
certain to be warm. Besides, there isn't a
place in town big enough for all that
school."</p>

<p>But this time it was Jean and not the
paper that was mistaken. In just a few
days the School Board announced that its
hopes were realized. It had found "suitable
quarters" for all the classes. Two
grades went into the basement of the Baptist
Church. The underground portion of the
Methodist edifice accommodated two more.
The A. O. U. W. Hall opened its doors to
three others. A benevolent private citizen
took in the kindergarten. A downtown
store hastily transformed itself from an unsuccessful
harness shop into nearly as unsuccessful
a haven for two other grades.
The City Hall gave up its Council Chamber
to the Seniors, and the Masons loaned their
dining-room to the Juniors, without, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
providing any refreshment. The enterprising
Board had telegraphed for desks
the very day of the fire; and as soon as that
dreadfully prompt furniture arrived, it was
remorselessly screwed into place. The Stationer,
too, had speedily ordered books.
They, too, traveled with unseemly haste
from New York to Lakeville. By Thursday,
less than a week after the fire, there
were desks and seats and books for everybody;
and would you believe it, they even
kept school on Saturday, that week!</p>

<p>And now, an utterly unforeseen thing happened.
Hitherto Jean, who was usually the
first to be ready, had stopped for Marjory
and Bettie. All three had stopped to finish
dressing Mabel, who always needed a great
deal of assistance, and then all four had
walked merrily to school together. But
now this happy scheme was entirely ruined,
for here was Jean doing algebra under the
Baptist roof, Bettie struggling with grammar
in the Methodist basement, Marjory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
climbing two long flights of stairs to the
A. O. U. W. Hall and Mabel passing six
saloons to reach her desk in the made-over
harness shop.</p>

<p>"It isn't just what we'd choose," apologized
the School Board, "but it won't last
forever. We'll build just as soon as we
can."</p>

<p>Except for the inconvenience of having
to go to school separately the children were
rather pleased with the novelty of moving
into such unusual quarters as the Board had
provided; but the mothers were not at all
satisfied.</p>

<p>"That Baptist cellar is damp and Jean's
throat is delicate," complained Mrs. Mapes.
"I know she'll be sick half the winter; but
of course she'll have to go to school there as
long as there's no better place."</p>

<p>"That Methodist Church is no place for
children," declared Mrs. Tucker. "Its
brick walls were condemned seven years ago
and it's likely to fall down at any moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
even if they did brace it up with iron bands.
But Bettie's too far behind now for me to
take her out of school, so I suppose she'll just
have to risk having that church tumble in
on her."</p>

<p>"It's a shame," sputtered Aunty Jane,
"for Marjory to climb all those stairs twice
a day. It's all very well for the Ancient
Order of United Workmen to climb two
flights with grown-up legs, but it isn't right
for delicate girls. However, there's no help
for it just now, and I can't say I blame the
child for sliding down the banisters, though
of course I do scold her for it."</p>

<p>"There are saloons on both sides of that
harness shop," said Mrs. Bennett, "and six
more this side of it, besides a livery stable
that is always full of loafers and bad language.
Mabel has never been allowed to go
to that part of town alone, and now I have
to send a maid with her twice a day. But
of course she has to go, even if the maid
<i>is</i> more timid than Mabel is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"By next year," consoled the Board,
"we'll have a bigger and better schoolhouse
than the old one. In the meantime we must
all have patience."</p>

<p>Except that Mabel, without the others to
get her started, was always late and that
Bettie, without Marjory to coach her on the
way, found it difficult to learn her lessons,
school life went on very much as usual, for
matters soon settled down as things always
do and Lakeville turned its attention to
fresher problems.</p>

<p>Poor Bettie, indeed, was busier than ever
because Miss Rossitor, the Domestic Science
teacher, whose classes were temporarily
housed in the Methodist kitchen, discovered
that Bettie could draw. Every day or two
she asked Bettie to remain after school to
copy needed illustrations on the blackboard.
One day, Miss Rossitor demanded a cow.
She needed it, she explained, to show her
class the different cuts of meat.</p>

<p>"A side view of a plain cow," said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think," said Bettie, reflectively nibbling
the fresh stick of chalk, "that I could
do the outside of that cow, but I know I
couldn't get his veal cutlets in the proper
spot."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a diagram," smiled Miss
Rossitor, "for I see very plainly, that it
wouldn't be safe not to."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss Bettie thinks," ventured
a belated pupil, a pink-cheeked girl with an
impertinent nose, "that one cow is a whole
butcher shop."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Miss Rossitor, meaningly,
"it isn't a great while since some
other folks were of the same opinion. But,
since you are now so very much wiser, you
may label the parts after Bettie has drawn
them."</p>

<p>The girl made such a comical face that
Bettie's gravity was in sad danger, but she
accepted the chalk. On the cow's shoulder
she printed "Pork sausages," on the flank,
"Mutton chops," on the backbone, "Oysters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
on the half-shell," on the breast,
"buttons."</p>

<p>Bettie looked puzzled and doubtful but
Miss Rossitor laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Henrietta Bedford," she said, "you're
a complete humbug. If you don't settle
down to business you won't get home to-night."</p>

<p>"I'm going to walk home with Bettie,"
returned Henrietta, quickly substituting the
proper labels. "I can easily write out that
luncheon menu while she's putting feathers
on the cow's tail."</p>

<p>And the new girl did walk home with
Bettie, and teased her so merrily all the long
way that Bettie didn't know whether to like
her or not.</p>

<p>Near the Cottage they met Jean, Marjory
and Mabel just starting out to look for belated
Bettie.</p>

<p>"This," said Bettie introducing her
new acquaintance, "is Henrietta&mdash;Henrietta&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Plantagenet," assisted Henrietta Bedford,
smoothly. "I am really a Duchess in
disguise, but I've left all my retainers in Ohio
and I'm simply dying for friends. This is
my day for collecting them&mdash;I always collect
friends on Tuesdays. You are indeed
fortunate to have happened upon me on
Tuesday. But, Elizabeth, why not finish
your introductions?"</p>

<p>"This," obeyed overwhelmed Bettie, "is
Jean, this is Marjory and this is Mabel
Bennett."</p>

<p>"What! The Damsel of the Dust-chute!
I am indeed honored."</p>

<p>Then, as her quick eye traveled over
Mabel's plump figure, Henrietta added
wickedly:</p>

<p>"Was that chute built to fit?"</p>

<p>Mabel flushed angrily.</p>

<p>"It is I," apologized Henrietta, "that
should wear those blushes. Forgive me,
dear Damsel. I have an over-quick tongue
and all my speeches are followed by repentance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
But I have a warm heart and I'm
really much nicer than I sound. See, I
kneel at your insulted feet."</p>

<p>Whereupon this ridiculous girl with the
impertinent nose flopped down on her knees
on the sidewalk and made such comically
repentant faces that all four giggled merrily.</p>

<p>"Get up, you goose," laughed Mabel.
"Your apology is accepted."</p>

<p>"Come along with us," urged Jean.
"We're going to have hot chocolate at our
house. Mother is trying to fatten Marjory,
Bettie and me."</p>

<p>"She seems to succeed best with&mdash;hum&mdash;no
personal remarks, please. Dear maiden,
I will inspect your home from the outside,
but I regret that I'm strictly forbidden to go
<i>in</i>side any strange house without my grandmother's
permission. You'll have to call on
me first. She is <i>very</i> particular in such
matters. But," added Henrietta, with a
sudden twinkle, "I'm not. So, if you'll
kindly rush in and make that chocolate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
there's no earthly reason why I shouldn't
stand just outside your gate and drink it."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Bettie, "is it possible that
you're Mrs. Howard Slater's new granddaughter?"</p>

<p>"I am," admitted Henrietta, "but I'm
not so new as you seem to think. She has
owned me for fourteen years. Now, hustle
up that chocolate. I've just remembered
that I'm to have a dress tried on at four. It
is now half-past."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>An Invitation</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>"BETTIE," asked Jean, when the girls
were "hustling up" the chocolate in
Mrs. Mapes' kitchen (the weather was now
too cold for Dandelion Cottage to be habitable),
"where did you find her?"</p>

<p>"At school," replied Bettie. "She comes
in for Domestic Science. I've seen her
about three times, and every time she's had
that stiff Miss Rossitor laughing. You
know who that girl is, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I've heard something," said Marjory,
"but I can't just remember what, about some
girl named Henrietta."</p>

<p>"Well, you've seen Mrs. Howard
Slater?"</p>

<p>All the girls had seen Mrs. Slater, the
beautifully gowned, decidedly aristocratic
old lady with abundant but perfectly white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hair and bright, sparkling black eyes. Mrs.
Slater, who seemed a very reserved and exclusive
person, had spent many summers and
even an occasional winter in her own handsome
home in Lakeville. She lived alone
except for a number of servants; for both
her son and her daughter were married.
The son lived abroad, no one knew just
where; and some four years previously Mrs.
Slater's daughter, who was Henrietta's
mother, had died in Rome. Since that
event Henrietta had been cared for by her
uncle's wife; and she had spent a winter in
California and another in Florida with her
grandmother, but this was her first visit to
Lakeville. It was said that Henrietta's
mother had left her little daughter a very
respectable fortune, that her father, an
English traveler of note, was also wealthy,
and it was known to a certainty that Mrs.
Howard Slater was a moneyed person.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marjory, replying to Bettie's
question, "we sit behind Mrs. Slater in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
church, and she's the very daintiest old lady
that ever lived. She's as slim and straight
as any young girl. She's perfectly lovely to
look at, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'but,'" agreed Jean. "She seems
very proud and not very&mdash;get-nearable. I
don't know whether I'd like to live with her
or not; but I know I'd feel terribly set up
to own a few relatives that <i>looked</i> like that."</p>

<p>"How do you like Henrietta?" asked
Mabel.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Bettie.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," replied Jean.</p>

<p>"It takes time," declared Marjory, "to
discover whether you like a person or not.
And when it's such a different person&mdash;truly,
she isn't a bit like any other girl in this town&mdash;it
takes longer."</p>

<p>"The chocolate's ready," announced Jean,
opening a box of wafers. "Here, Bettie,
you carry Henrietta's cup and I'll take these.
Let's <i>all</i> have our chocolate on the sidewalk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Henrietta, her hands in her pockets, was
leaning against the fence and humming a
tune. Her voice, in speaking, was very
nicely modulated&mdash;which was fortunate, because
she used it a great deal. She straightened
up when the door opened.</p>

<p>"I'm an icicle," said she. "I hope that
chocolate's good and hot. My! What a
nice big cup! And wafers! I'm glad I
stayed for your party. I've had chocolate
in France, in Germany, in Italy, in Switzerland
and in England, but I do believe this is
the very first time I've had any in America."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Jean, "that you have
to have your first on the sidewalk."</p>

<p>"I shan't, next time," promised Henrietta.
"I have a beautiful plan. I made it
while waiting for the chocolate. You're all
to come after school to-morrow and pay me
a formal call. Then I'll return it. After
that, I suspect I shall be allowed to run in.
But first you'll have to call, formally."</p>

<p>"A formal call!" gasped Bettie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"We never made a formal call in all our
lives," objected Jean.</p>

<p>"They're dreadful," agreed Henrietta,
"but in this case you'll really have to do it.
I've planned it all nicely. In the first place,
you must hand your cards to the butler&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cards!" gasped Jean and Bettie.</p>

<p>"Cards!" snorted Mabel, flushing indignantly.
"We haven't a card to our
names!"</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> have them," declared Henrietta,
firmly, "or Simmons may consider you
suspicious characters. Simmons is a very
lofty person. You can write some, you
know, because Simmons holds his chin so
high that it interferes with the view, so he'll
never know what's on them. Then you
must be very polite to Grandmother and say
'Yes, ma'am,' 'No, ma'am,' 'Thank you,
ma'am'&mdash;and not very much else. You've
seen Grandmother, of course? Then you
know how very formal and stiff she looks.
Well, <i>you</i> must be like that, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll try," said Mabel, "but it'll be pretty
hard work."</p>

<p>"Be sure to wear gloves," cautioned
Henrietta. "Grandmother is exceedingly
particular about shoes and gloves. I know
it's a lot of trouble, but you'll find it pays;
for after you've beaten down the icy barrier
that surrounds me, you'll find me quite a
comfortable person. And <i>do</i> come just as
early as you can&mdash;I'm really desperately
lonely."</p>

<p>This was a different Henrietta from the
merry one that Bettie had encountered.
That other Henrietta had made her laugh.
This one, with the wistful, sorrowful countenance
and the four words "I'm really
desperately lonely," was almost moving her
to tears.</p>

<p>"You'll surely come," pleaded Henrietta.</p>

<p>"We'll come," promised Bettie, "cards
and all."</p>

<p>"<i>Au revoir</i>," said Henrietta, carefully
balancing her cup on the top rail of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
fence. "I must run along now to try on
my clothes."</p>

<p>"Was that French?" queried Mabel, gazing
after the departing figure.</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Jean.</p>

<p>"She can certainly talk English fast
enough," said Marjory. "I suppose just
one language <i>isn't</i> enough for anybody that
chatters like that."</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked Bettie, "she
meant all that about cards and gloves and
butlers? She's so full of fun most of the
time that I don't exactly know whether to
believe her or not."</p>

<p>"I think she did," said Marjory. "You
see, I sit behind Mrs. Slater in church&mdash;and
I'm thankful that it's behind."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's the reason," ventured
Bettie, "that nobody'll rent the three pews
in front of her. Father says it's hard to
even give them away. No one likes to sit
in them."</p>

<p>"That's it," agreed Marjory. "One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
would have to be sure that her back hair was
absolutely perfect to be at all comfortable in
front of Mrs. Slater."</p>

<p>"And that," groaned discouraged Mabel,
"is the sort of person I'm to make my first
formal call on."</p>

<p>"You'd better take your bath to-night,"
advised Jean, "and lay out all your very
best clothes. And don't forget to polish
your shoes."</p>

<p>"Father has some blank cards," said
Bettie, "and he writes beautifully. I'll get
him to do cards for all of us."</p>

<p>"I think," said Marjory, with a puzzled
air, "that we ought to take five or six apiece.
I know Aunty Jane leaves a whole lot at one
house, sometimes."</p>

<p>"No," corrected Jean, "we need just two.
One for Mrs. Slater and one for Henrietta.
My aunt, Mrs. Halliday, always gets two
whenever her sister-in-law is visiting there."</p>

<p>"There are holes in my best gloves,"
mourned Bettie. "They came in a missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
box, and missionary gloves are
never very good even to start with. Besides,
Dick wore them first&mdash;I never had a <i>new</i>
pair of kid gloves."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said always generous
Mabel. "I must have about six pairs and
I've never had any of the things on. I
know I've outgrown some of them. Your
hands are lots smaller than mine. Come
over and I'll fix you out&mdash;Mother said we'd
have to give them to somebody and I guess
you're just exactly the right somebody. I
hate the thing myself."</p>

<p>"Goody!" rejoiced Bettie.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Jean, "that my shoes were
newer, but I'll get the boys to black 'em."</p>

<p>"I can't help <i>you</i> out," laughed Mabel.
"My shoes are short and fat and yours are
long and slim."</p>

<p>"A coat of Wallace's blacking will be all
that's needed, thank you, Mabel. There's
nothing like having brothers when it comes
to blacking shoes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll have to get up a little earlier to-morrow
morning," said Marjory.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" exclaimed Jean, "are you
leaving all those chocolate cups on the fence
for <i>me</i> to carry in?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said obliging Bettie,
seizing two. "Come on, you lazy people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>Obeying Instructions</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE four girls were wonderfully excited
all the next day. They were restless
in school and fidgety at home.</p>

<p>"A body would think," scoffed Aunty
Jane, at noon, "that you were going to your
own wedding. Don't worry so. I'll have
everything ready for you to put on the moment
you get out of school."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," breathed Marjory,
fervently. "That'll help a lot; but I do
hope that Bettie's father will remember to
do those cards. And, Aunty Jane, <i>could</i> you
lend me a perfectly inkless hankerchief?"</p>

<p>"Jumping January!" growled Wallace
Mapes, Jean's older brother. "That makes
nineteen times, Jean, that you've reminded
me of those miserable shoes. I'll black
them when I've finished lunch. I'm not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
going to rush off in the middle of my oyster
soup to black <i>any</i>body's best shoes."</p>

<p>"Is it a reception?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"No," replied Wallace, "just a formal
call on Henrietta Bedford."</p>

<p>"She's in my French class," said Roger.
"And kippered snakes! You ought to hear
her recite. She talks up and down and all
around poor little Miss McGinnis, whose
French was made right here in Lakeville.
It's a daily picnic."</p>

<p>"You won't forget my shoes, will you?"
reminded anxious Jean.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know how I <i>could</i>," demanded
Wallace, feelingly.</p>

<p>Although Mabel had taken a most complete
bath the night before, she spent the
noon-hour taking another. She put on her
best stockings and shoes, but looked doubtfully
at her Sunday suit.</p>

<p>"If I have to do my language in ink," reflected
she, "it'll be all up with my clothes.
I'll just have to change after school."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls were out by half-past three.
Fortunately, Miss Rossitor needed no more
cows that afternoon, so Bettie was home in
good season. All four dressed speedily.
Three of them got into their gloves unassisted;
but Jean, Marjory and Bettie found
plump, impatient Mabel seated on the piano
stool with her mother working over one
hand, her perspiring father over the other.
Several other gloves that had proved too
small were scattered on the floor.</p>

<p>"You needn't think," said Mabel, greeting
her friends with an expressive grimace,
"that <i>I</i> ever picked out these lemon-colored
frights. Somebody sent 'em for Christmas.
None of the pretty ones were big enough&mdash;I've
tried four pairs."</p>

<p>"Neither are these," returned Mrs. Bennett,
"and the color certainly is outrageous,
but it's Hobson's choice. And just remember,
Mabel, if you touch a single door-knob
they'll be black before you get there.
And don't put your hands in your pockets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
And <i>please</i> don't rub them along the fences.
There! Mine's on as far as it will go."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i0186.jpg" width="600" height="387" alt="Four girls in hats and coats" />
<div class="caption">THE DECIDEDLY DEPRESSED FOUR STARTED DOWN THE STREET.</div>
</div>

<p>"I guess you'd better finish this one,"
said Dr. Bennett, abandoning his task.
"I rather tackle a case of smallpox than
wrestle with another job like that. She'd
look much better in mittens."</p>

<p>"Mittens!" snubbed Mabel. "You can't
make formal calls in mittens! Now, Somebody,
please put me into my jacket and hat,
if I'm not to touch anything."</p>

<p>The decidedly depressed four, in their
Sunday best, started down the street.
Mabel's gloves, owing to their brilliant
color, were certainly conspicuous, and unconsciously
she made them more so by the careful
and rigid manner in which she carried
them. It was plain that she had them very
much on her mind. And when her hat tilted
forward over one eye she left it there rather
than risk damaging those immaculate lemon-hued
gloves.</p>

<p>"Take my muff," implored Marjory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
"That yellow splendor lights up the whole
street."</p>

<p>"No, siree," declined Mabel. "If Mrs.
Slater wants gloves she's going to have 'em.
Do you think I'm going to suffer like this
and not have 'em <i>show</i>?"</p>

<p>So Mabel, a swollen, imprisoned but
gorgeous hand dangling at each side, a big
navy-blue hat flopping over one eye, strutted
muffless down the street.</p>

<p>"That's the house," announced Jean, as
they turned the corner. "That big one
with the covered driveway."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" shuddered Marjory, "it gives
me chills to think of ringing such a wealthy
doorbell. Are the cards safe, Bettie? My!
I hope you haven't lost them."</p>

<p>"In my pocket in an envelope," assured
Bettie.</p>

<p>"Can you see any white?" queried Jean,
nervously. "I think my top petticoat has
broken loose."</p>

<p>"It seems all right," said Marjory, stooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to test it with little sharp jerks. "Firm
as the Rock of Gibraltar."</p>

<p>"It won't be if you pull like that," objected
Jean.</p>

<p>"Somebody open the gate," requested
Mabel. "I can't touch things."</p>

<p>"Everybody stand up straight," commanded
Marjory. "We must look our
best when we go up the walk."</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't come," demurred Bettie,
hanging back, diffidently. "Let's wait till
it's darker."</p>

<p>"No," asserted Jean. "We'd better get
it over."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mabel, "I don't want to
wear these gloves a minute longer than I
have to."</p>

<p>"All right," sighed Bettie, despondently,
"but you go first, Jean."</p>

<p>They had waited on the imposing doorstep
for a long five minutes when it occurred
to Marjory to ask if any one had pushed the
bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," replied Jean, with a surprised air.
"I thought <i>you</i> had."</p>

<p>"And I," said Bettie, "supposed that
Mabel had."</p>

<p>"How could I," demanded Mabel, hotly,
"in these gloves?"</p>

<p>And then, all four began to giggle.
Never before had such an inopportune fit of
helpless, hysterical giggling seized the Cottagers.
No one could stop. Tears rolled
down Mabel's plump cheeks, and, fettered
by her lemon-colored gloves, she had to let
them roll, until Bettie wiped them away. And
that set them all off again. In the midst of
it Marjory's sharp elbow inadvertently struck
the push-bell and Simmons, the imposing,
much-dreaded butler, opened the door. Instantly
the giggling ceased. Four exceedingly
solemn little girls filed into the big hall.
Bettie groped nervously for her pocket,
found it and endeavored to extract the
cards. But the large, stiff envelope stuck
and, for a long, embarrassing moment, Bettie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
fumbled in vain; while the butler, his
chin "very high and scornful" as Marjory
said afterwards, waited.</p>

<p>At last the cards were out. Diffident
Bettie dropped them, envelope and all, on
the extended plate; but Jean deftly seized
the envelope and shook out the cards. Next
followed a most unhappy moment. Simmons
was evidently expecting them to do
<i>something</i>, they hadn't the remotest idea
what.</p>

<p>Then, to their great relief, there was a
sudden "swish" of silken skirts, a flash of
scarlet and lively Henrietta, who had slid
down the broad banister, was greeting them
warmly.</p>

<p>"Grandmother's out," said she. "Come
up to my room and have a real visit before
she gets back. Simmons, just toddle down
to the lower regions for some fruit and anything
else you can find; send them up to my
room."</p>

<p>Something very like a smile flitted across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Simmons's wooden countenance. Perhaps
it amused him to be ordered to "toddle."</p>

<p>"Do you like my new gown?" queried
Henrietta, leading the way upstairs and
flirting her accordion-pleated skirts in graceful
fashion. "It's my dinner dress. I
have to dress for dinner every night&mdash;such
a fuss for just two of us. Come in here&mdash;this
is my sitting-room."</p>

<p>"How very odd," said Jean, finding her
voice at last.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" laughed Henrietta, shaking
her brown curls. She wore them tied back
with two enormous black bows. "Grandmother's
a mixture of everything, you know&mdash;French,
English, New York Dutch&mdash;and
her furniture shows it. Lots of it came
from Europe and Father picked up things
in India and China&mdash;such a jolly dad as he
is. That's why this place is such a jumble."</p>

<p>"I like it," declared Jean. "It looks interesting&mdash;as
if there were lovely stories
in it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are," said Henrietta, drawing
aside a heavy, silken curtain, "and I keep
making new ones to fit. This is my bedroom,
this next one is my dressing-room and
this is my bath."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" shuddered Mabel, "do you take
shower baths?"</p>

<p>"Every morning," laughed Henrietta.</p>

<p>"What a lovely dressing table!" exclaimed
Bettie, peering into the oval mirror
and smiling into her own dark eyes. "I
never saw such pretty things, even in a
catalogue."</p>

<p>"It's French," said Henrietta, "but all
those little jeweled boxes came from Calcutta&mdash;Father
just loves to buy little boxes
with inlaid tops. Oh, here's Greta, with
things to eat." Henrietta hastily swept her
belongings from a dainty little table and the
smiling maid deposited the heavy tray.</p>

<p>"Tangerines, nuts, figs and sponge cake,"
chattered Henrietta. "That's very nice,
Greta. Help yourselves to chairs, girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Here's a tabouret for you, little Marjory.
Catch, Jean," and the merry little hostess
tossed a golden tangerine to Jean. "Oh,
wait," she added. "You mustn't take off
your gloves or get them soiled, because
Grandmother always gets in about this time,
and you know you must be very formal with
Grandmother. I'll peel them for you. Now
draw up closer. You mustn't spot your
gloves, so I'll feed you. First, a bit of
sponge cake all around. Now an almond.
Now the orange. Oh, I'm forgetting myself!
Now more sponge cake."</p>

<p>"This is fine," said Bettie. "I'm always
hungry after school."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Jean.</p>

<p>"If I'd s'posed," said Mabel, "that formal
calls were like this, I'd have started
sooner."</p>

<p>"Are you a different person every time
anybody sees you?" asked Bettie, curiously.</p>

<p>"Why?" queried Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Because," explained Bettie, "you seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
so very changeable. You're a mischief in
school, yesterday you seemed almost sad and
to-day you're so polite."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>thank</i> you," said Henrietta, rising
to sweep a deep and very much exaggerated
courtesy. "Nobody <i>ever</i> before said that I
was polite."</p>

<p>"Miss Henrietta," said Greta, tapping at
the door, "the carriage has just turned the
corner."</p>

<p>"Follow me," said Henrietta, with an instant
change of tone, as she hurriedly
brushed the crumbs from her lap and pulled
Mabel's jacket into place. "Follow me and
don't make a sound. It's time to be formal."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>With Henrietta</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THROUGH a long corridor, around
several corners and down two flights
of back stairs, the formal callers, their
hearts in their throats, followed Henrietta,
who finally paused at the basement
door.</p>

<p>"There," said Henrietta, mysteriously,
"you're safe at last. Now listen. You
must slip out through the alley, walk slowly
round the block, approach the house with
dignity, ring the doorbell and present your
cards to Simmons."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we can't," faltered Bettie. "He
has them <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>"I'll poke them out through the letter
slot," laughed resourceful Henrietta.
"You're not going to escape that formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
call. Wait, your hat's over one ear, Mabel.
There now, you're perfectly lovely. Now
don't forget to pick up the cards."</p>

<p>Entirely bewildered by Henrietta's pranks,
the conventional visitors walked out through
the alley, strolled round the block and nervously
ascended the front steps. There, sure
enough, were eight white cards popping out
through the letter slot.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" gasped Jean, "they're
not <i>our</i> cards. This one says 'Mrs. Francis
Patterson.'"</p>

<p>"And this," said Marjory, picking up another,
"says 'John D. Thomas, sole agent
for Todd's shoes.'"</p>

<p>"According to mine," giggled Bettie,
"I'm Miss Ethel Louise Cartwright. What's
on yours, Mabel?"</p>

<p>"'With love from Father,'" groaned
Mabel.</p>

<p>"What in the world shall we do?"
queried Jean, gathering up the remaining
cards. "Not one of them will fit <i>us</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give them to Simmons in a bunch," suggested
Marjory. "He didn't look at the
last lot, so perhaps he won't now."</p>

<p>So the girls, gathering what courage they
could, touched the bell, presented their odd
assortment of cards to Simmons&mdash;who
almost succeeded in not looking astonished
at seeing the callers again so soon&mdash;and
were ushered into the reception room.</p>

<p>Such a sedate Henrietta advanced to meet
them! Such a dignified, but charming old
lady rose to shake hands all around!
Such a sheepish quartette of visitors perched
on the extreme edge of the nearest four
chairs! Mrs. Slater smiled encouragingly;
but Henrietta, from her post behind her
grandmother's chair, displayed every sign of
abject terror.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we came to call," faltered Jean.</p>

<p>"That was pleasant," responded Mrs.
Slater. "You are just in time to have some
tea. Midge, will you please ring for Greta?
I'm very glad you came, for I wanted my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
granddaughter to meet some of the young
people."</p>

<p>Mrs. Slater, her slender, beringed fingers
moving daintily among the cups, made the
tea. Henrietta, in absolute silence and much
subdued in manner, passed the cups, the
delicate sandwiches and the little frosted tea
cakes.</p>

<p>"Midge," demanded Mrs. Slater, turning
suddenly to her granddaughter, "what in
the world is the matter with you? You
haven't said a word for fifteen minutes. I
never knew you to be still for so long a
time."</p>

<p>"It's my conscience," groaned Henrietta,
dolefully. "I'm in another scrape."</p>

<p>"What have you done now?" asked Mrs.
Slater, who seemed very much less terrifying
than the girls had expected to find her.
"Confession is good for the soul, my dear."</p>

<p>Henrietta's infectious laugh gurgled out
suddenly and merrily.</p>

<p>"I've frightened four girls almost into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
spasms," said she. "You see, Grannie, I
told them that they'd <i>have</i> to call formally if
they wanted me to visit them. When they
came you were out, so I took them upstairs,
gave them things to eat and a jolly good
time, generally. Then, just for a joke, I
had Greta tell me when you were coming
and I led them carefully down the back way,
made them go round the block and do it all
over again, cards and all. You see, Grannie,
they don't know you. They haven't seen
anything but your husk; and I had them
scared blue; didn't I, girls?"</p>

<p>"Midge, you shouldn't have done it," reproved
Mrs. Slater, whose black eyes, however,
were sparkling with only half-suppressed
merriment. "That wasn't quite a
courteous way to treat your guests!"</p>

<p>"Forgive me," pleaded Henrietta, flopping
down on her knees and looking the very
picture of penitence. "Walk on me, Jean.
Wipe your shoes on me, Bettie. I grovel at
your feet&mdash;at <i>every</i>body's feet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't grovel too hard in that dress,"
warned Mrs. Slater.</p>

<p>"Am I forgiven?" implored Henrietta,
gathering up her ruffles with elaborate care.</p>

<p>The girls were not certain. Their pride
had been injured and they eyed Henrietta
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"When you've known Midge as long as
I have," said Mrs. Slater, "you'll discover
that she is really too tender-hearted to hurt
a fly. But you'll also discover that she
never misses an opportunity to play pranks
on every soul she loves. It's a symbol of
her favor. She will never tell you an untruth,
she is too honorable to practise downright
deceit; but depend on it, girls, she will
fool you until you won't believe your own
ears. And she's always sorry, afterwards.
She spends half her time apologizing."</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>do</i> forgive," pleaded extravagant
Henrietta, suddenly extending imploring
hands. "I mean it, truly. It <i>wasn't</i> nice
of me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean, stooping suddenly, kissed the upturned
lips.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Jean, genuinely surprised,
"I didn't know I was going to do
that."</p>

<p>"She gets around everybody," said Mrs.
Slater, "and the worst of it is she's so good
and so naughty that you'll never know
whether you like her or not."</p>

<p>"Why, Grannie!" exclaimed Henrietta,
"don't <i>you</i> know?"</p>

<p>"I know that I like you," said the old
lady, smiling fondly at pretty, whimsical
Henrietta, "but you know very well that I
also regard you with strong disapproval. I
consider you a very faulty young person."</p>

<p>"You're a dear Grannie," breathed Henrietta,
kissing the old lady's delicate hand,
"but I'm quite sure you're spoiling me; isn't
she, Bettie?"</p>

<p>"Were you like Henrietta," queried Jean,
"when you were young?"</p>

<p>"My dear, you've found me out," laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Mrs. Slater. "I was just such a piece of
impishness; but my father was very severe,
and I think I began earlier to restrain my
prankishness. Midge, unfortunately, has a
lenient father and a doting grandmother.
Between them she is having pretty much her
own way."</p>

<p>"I'll be good," promised Henrietta, comically,
"in spite of them; but you see, girls,
with such a pair of relatives dogging my
footsteps, it's uphill work."</p>

<p>After a little more conversation, the girls
rose to depart. Mrs. Slater begged them to
come again. She said that she enjoyed
young people. Then the big front door was
closed behind them and the dreaded visit was
over.</p>

<p>"So," said Marjory, "<i>that's</i> what Mrs.
Slater is like inside."</p>

<p>Mabel, unable to bear them longer, was
recklessly peeling off her lemon-colored
gloves.</p>

<p>"She's lovely, inside and out," declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Bettie, "but I never dreamed that she was
like <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't have cared if I <i>had</i> gone
without gloves," mourned aggrieved Mabel.
"I'd like to pay Henrietta back for <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"Girls," asked Marjory, "do you <i>like</i>
Henrietta?"</p>

<p>"I adore her," declared Jean.</p>

<p>"I <i>think</i> I like her," said Bettie.</p>

<p>"I know <i>I</i> don't," asserted Mabel, waving
her throbbing hands in the evening breeze
to cool them.</p>

<p>"I do and I don't," said Marjory. "I admire
her, but she makes me uncomfortable.
I feel as if she were just playing with me."</p>

<p>"She seems more than fourteen," murmured
Jean, dreamily.</p>

<p>"That's because she's traveled so much,"
explained Bettie.</p>

<p>"She's like the big opal in Mother's ring,"
mused imaginative Jean. "One moment all
warm and sparkly, the next, all cold and
quiet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you never know," supplemented
Marjory, "which way it's going to be."</p>

<p>"I like folks that are downright bad or
good," said Mabel, crossly. "Burglars
ought to be burglars and ministers ought to
be ministers and they all ought to be marked
so you can tell 'em apart; else, how are you
going to?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>The Call Returned</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE following Saturday, the girls carried
their Christmas sewing to Jean's.
The sewing had not reached a very exciting
stage, so tongues moved faster than fingers.
Mabel was still working on a shoe-bag for
her father but, owing to some misadventure,
one of the two compartments was several
sizes larger than the other. Mabel regarded
this difference with disapproval until comforting
Jean came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Jean, "there's a
difference in the size of your father's feet."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is," cried Mabel, gleefully.
"His right shoe is always tighter than the
left."</p>

<p>"But," objected quick-witted Marjory,
"it isn't his feet that are going into that bag.
It's his shoes, and they're the same size."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," groaned Mabel, settling into a disconsolate
heap, "that's so."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Bettie. "Give me
the bag, and I'll fix those pockets."</p>

<p>Bettie was embroidering an elaborate pincushion
for her mother, but she stopped so
often to help the others that there seemed
small hope of its ever getting finished.
Marjory, who was making one just like it
for her Aunty Jane, was progressing much
more rapidly.</p>

<p>Jean, rummaging in her work-bag, was
trying to decide which of four partly completed
articles to sew on when a carriage
stopped at Mrs. Mapes's gate.</p>

<p>"It's a caller," said Jean. "We'll have
to vacate. Here, scurry into the dining-room
with all your stuff. I'll answer the
bell; and you, Bettie, remind Mother to take
off her apron&mdash;she's apt to forget it."</p>

<p>Jean, stopping long enough to twitch the
chairs into place, went primly to the door.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said a familiar voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
"I've come to return your visit. It's all
right, James. You needn't wait."</p>

<p>"Come back, girls," called Jean, when she
had ushered the caller in. "It's Henrietta."</p>

<p>"What luck!" cried Henrietta, pulling off
her gloves. "Now I can make a long, long
call instead of four short ones. What are
you doing&mdash;Christmas presents? Give me
a spool of fine white thread, some pins and a
sofa pillow. I'm going to make one, too."</p>

<p>"Take off your things," said Jean,
smilingly.</p>

<p>Henrietta wriggled out of her jacket and
tossed her hat on the couch.</p>

<p>"What is it going to be?" asked Bettie,
watching the merry visitor's deft fingers fly
to and fro.</p>

<p>"Lace," returned Henrietta. "I learned
to make it in France. Of course these aren't
the right materials for very fine lace, but I
can make an edge for a pincushion or a mat.
I like to do things with my fingers."</p>

<p>"Can you draw?" asked Bettie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little," returned Henrietta, modestly,
"but you mustn't tell Miss Rossitor, or she'll
have <i>me</i> doing cows and pigs and roosters."</p>

<p>"What grade do you belong in?" asked
Jean.</p>

<p>"None," laughed the visitor, arranging
the pins in what looked like a very intricate
pattern. "I couldn't be graded. I'm having
Domestic Science under the Methodist
church, Senior Latin in the Council Chamber,
Post-graduate French in a cloak-room off the
A. O. U. W. Hall, Sophomore American
History with the Baptists, and I'm doing
mathematics in the kindergarten&mdash;or somewhere
down there. I had to go back to the
very beginning. If I ever tell you anything
with numbers in it don't believe it. I don't
know six from six hundred. But I'm doing
lessons in five different buildings and getting
lots of exercise besides. That's doing pretty
well for my first year in school."</p>

<p>"Your first year!" cried Marjory.
"Surely you're fooling!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not this time," assured Henrietta.
"I've had governesses and tutors ever since
I could think, but this is truly my first school
year. And it's great fun. But if I stay in
America, I'm to go to boarding school,
Grandmother says. I've always wanted to,
and Grannie thinks it will be good for me to
be with other girls. You see, I've always
lived with grown folks, so I need to renew
my youth."</p>

<p>"Mother's been reading the boarding-school
advertisements in the magazines
lately," said Mabel. "I heard her read some
of them aloud to Father. But of course
they couldn't have been thinking about <i>me</i>.
But they sounded interesting."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," offered Bettie, "they had read
all the stories and those boarding schools
were all they had left to read."</p>

<p>"I guess so," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Aunt Jane reads them, too," added Marjory.
"There's some money that is to be
used for my education and for nothing else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
When I've finished with High School I'm to
go to College."</p>

<p>"Oh well," laughed, Jean, lightly, "you're
safe for another five years."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>'m not," returned Henrietta. "I'm
going next September, and if Grandmother
had known how the schools were going to be
you wouldn't be having the pleasure of my
company now. She says I'm getting thin in
the pursuit of knowledge&mdash;it's too scattered,
in Lakeville. That's why she made me ride
to-day."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Mabel, her eyes bulging
with astonishment. "She's really making
lace!"</p>

<p>"It's for you," said Henrietta, flashing a
bright glance at Mabel. "It's an apology,
Mam'selle, for my past&mdash;and perhaps my
future&mdash;misdeeds."</p>

<p>"I <i>said</i> I didn't like you," blurted honest
Mabel, "but I do."</p>

<p>"Don't depend on me," sighed Henrietta.
"I don't wear well. You'll find the real me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
rubbing through in spots. Granny says I'm
an imp that came in one of Dad's Hindoo
boxes."</p>

<p>"Why does your grandmother call you
Midge?" asked Bettie.</p>

<p>"Because she doesn't like Henrietta. You
see, I have five names&mdash;they do that sort of
thing on the other side&mdash;and I take turns
with them. When I find out which one suits
me best, I'll choose that one for keeps."</p>

<p>"What are they?" demanded Mabel.</p>

<p>"Henrietta Constance Louise Frederika
Francesca&mdash;you see, there isn't a really suitable
name in the lot. But when you have
five quarrelsome aunts, as Father had, you
have to please all or none of them by giving
your poor helpless baby all their horrid
names. Call me Sallie&mdash;I've <i>always</i> wanted
to be Sallie."</p>

<p>"Think of anybody," laughed Jean, "with
as many names as that wanting a new one."</p>

<p>"Where's that baby you adopted?" asked
Henrietta, abruptly changing the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
"Didn't one of you adopt a baby or something
like that?"</p>

<p>"It was Mabel," replied Marjory. "The
rest of us are pretty good, but Mabel's sort
of thoughtless about borrowing things. She
just happened to borrow an unreturnable
baby, one day."</p>

<p>"Where is it now?"</p>

<p>"At Mr. Black's. Her name is Rosa
Marie."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see her," said Henrietta, carefully
moving a pin.</p>

<p>"Stay to luncheon," urged Jean.
"Father's away, so there'll be plenty of
room. Afterwards we can all pay a visit to
Rosa Marie."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said Marjory, "she's getting
to be a burden to Mrs. Crane."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Bettie, "but it isn't Rosa
Marie's fault. Mrs. Crane has been reading
a lot of books about bringing up children&mdash;you
know she never had any. Before she
discovered how many things <i>might</i> happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to a baby she was quite comfortable; but
now she's always certain that Rosa Marie
is coming down with something."</p>

<p>"And she doesn't seem very bright,"
mourned Jean.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;Mrs. Crane?"</p>

<p>"No, Rosa Marie. You see, we don't
know exactly how old she is&mdash;Mabel didn't
think to ask&mdash;but she seems big enough to
be lots smarter than she is. We're rather
disappointed in her."</p>

<p>"I'm not," protested Mabel, loyally.
"She's just slow because she hasn't any little
brothers and sisters. She's a <i>dear</i> child."</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Mabel," soothed Henrietta.
"As long as she's beautiful she doesn't need
to be bright."</p>

<p>At this, Marjory looked at Jean, then at
Bettie, and smiled an odd, significant smile.
Here was a chance to get even with Henrietta;
and, unconsciously, Mabel helped.</p>

<p>"She's beautiful to me," said Mabel,
"and she's ever so cunning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"What color are her eyes?"</p>

<p>"Dark," said Marjory. "Darker than
yours."</p>

<p>"Then she's a brunette?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," said Marjory, as if considering
the question. "She's darker, at least, than
I am."</p>

<p>"We all are," said Henrietta, with an admiring
glance at Marjory's golden locks.
"We seem to shade down gradually. Mabel
comes next, then Jean, then Bettie; I'm the
darkest, because Bettie's eyes are like brown
velvet, but mine are black, like bits of hard
coal. Where does Rosa Marie come in?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Marjory, with an air of
pondering deeply, "that Rosa Marie is almost,
if not quite, as dark as you; even
darker, perhaps. But her hair isn't as
curly."</p>

<p>"Dear little soul," breathed Henrietta,
tenderly. "I've a tremendous liking for
babies, but they're pretty scarce at our house.
But there was one in England that was&mdash;Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
if I could just see that English baby <i>now</i>!
Wouldn't I just hug her!"</p>

<p>Henrietta's eyes were unwontedly tender,
her expression unusually sweet.</p>

<p>"You're not a bit like you've been any of
the other times," observed Bettie. "I like
you a lot better when you're like this."</p>

<p>"I'm not myself to-day," twinkled Henrietta.
"I'm Sallie&mdash;just plain Sallie. But
beware of me when I'm Frederika, the Disguised
Duchess. <i>That's</i> when I'm not to be
trusted."</p>

<p>"I think," said Jean, listening to some faraway
sound, "that lunch is about ready."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Henrietta. "The
sooner it's over, the sooner I can hug that
darling baby. It's months since I've held
one in my arms&mdash;the dear little body."</p>

<p>"You'll find&mdash;&mdash;" began Mabel; but the
other three promptly headed her off before
she had time to explain that Rosa Marie was
a pretty big armful.</p>

<p>"It's time to go home," exclaimed Marjory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and Bettie, in chorus. "Come on,
Mabel."</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse me," said Jean, speaking
directly to Mabel, "I'll go set a place for
Henrietta. Sorry I can't ask everybody to
stay; but come back at two o'clock."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>Getting Even</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>LUNCHEON at Jean's that day proved
a lively affair, for both boys were
home; Henrietta chatted as frankly and as
merrily as if she had known them all her
life. Wallace, who was shy, squirmed uneasily
at first and kept his eyes on his plate;
but Roger, who had encountered the visitor
in his French class, was able to respond to
her friendly chatter.</p>

<p>"I like boys," asserted Henrietta, frankly,
"but I haven't any belonging to me but one
and he's a horrid muff&mdash;sixteen and a regular
baby. He's my cousin."</p>

<p>"I thought you liked babies," laughed
Jean.</p>

<p>"I do, but not that kind. He's been
molly-coddled until it makes you sick to look
at him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trot him out," offered Roger. "I'll
give him an antidote."</p>

<p>"He's in England," said Henrietta, "and
I hope he'll stay there. He hasn't any idea
of doing anything for himself; he's always
talking about what he'll do when somebody
else does such and such a thing for him."</p>

<p>"You mean," said Roger, "he hasn't any
American independence."</p>

<p>"That's it," agreed Henrietta. "He'd
have made a nice pink-and-white girl, but
he's no use at all as a boy."</p>

<p>"How dark it's getting," said Jean. "I
can hardly see my plate."</p>

<p>"I think," prophesied Wallace, breaking
his long silence, "that it's going to snow.
The sky's been a little thick for three days;
when it comes we'll get a lot."</p>

<p>"Goody!" cried Henrietta, "I've never
seen a real Lake Superior snowstorm and I
want to. So far all the snow we've had has
come in the night. I want to <i>see</i> it snow."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't," growled Wallace, "if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
you had to shovel several tons of it off your
sidewalk."</p>

<p>"Will it snow very soon?" queried Henrietta,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Probably not before dark," returned
Wallace, turning to glance at the dull sky.
"It's only getting ready."</p>

<p>Enthusiastic Henrietta, that odd mixture
of extreme youth and premature age, was all
impatience to see Rosa Marie. She had
telephoned her grandmother to ask permission
to spend the day with her new friends,
and now she was eager to add Rosa Marie to
the list. It was easy to see that she was expecting
to behold something very choice in
the line of babies. Jean was tempted to undeceive
her, but loyalty to Marjory kept her
silent.</p>

<p>"A baby," breathed Henrietta, rapturously,
"is the loveliest thing in all the world.
<i>Isn't</i> it most two o'clock? Wait, I'll look
at my watch&mdash;Mercy! I forgot to wind
it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hark!" said Jean, "I think I hear the
girls. Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Get on your things," commanded Marjory,
opening the door. "Bettie stopped to
feed the cat, sew a button on Dick, wash
Peter's face, tie up her father's finger and
hook her mother's dress, but she's here at
last and we're to pick up Mabel on the way
because Dr. Bennett called her back to wash
her face."</p>

<p>"We mustn't stay too long," warned Jean,
glancing at the dull sky. "It looks as if it
would get dark early."</p>

<p>Mrs. Crane was glad to see her visitors
and appeared delighted to add a new girl to
her collection of youthful friends.</p>

<p>"You and Jean are just of a size," said
she.</p>

<p>"And about the same age," added Bettie,
who had always regretted the two years' difference
in her age and Jean's. "I wish <i>I</i>
were as old as that."</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid," blundered well-meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Mrs. Crane, turning to Bettie,
"that she'll cut you out? You and Jean
have always been as thick as thieves. Don't
you let this pretty Henrietta steal your Jean
away from you."</p>

<p>Bettie, dear little unselfish soul, had
hitherto been conscious of no such fear, but
now her big brown eyes were troubled.
This new possibility was alarming.</p>

<p>"We'd like to see Rosa Marie," said Marjory.
"Is she well?"</p>

<p>"She has a bad cold," returned Mrs.
Crane, shaking her head, sorrowfully.
"I've just been looking through my books,
and in the very first one I found more than
twenty-five fatal diseases that begin with a
bad cold."</p>

<p>"Didn't you find <i>any</i> that folks ever get
over?" suggested Jean, comfortingly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," replied Mrs. Crane, brightening.
"I've known of folks pulling through
at least twenty-four of them. But there's
one thing. You won't like Rosa Marie's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
clothes to-day. They're&mdash;they're sort of an
accident."</p>

<p>"An accident?" questioned Bettie.
"What happened?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, I ordered her a ready-made
dress out of a catalogue. It sounded
very promising but&mdash;Well, it's <i>warm</i>, but I
guess that's about all you can say for it. I'll
take you to the nursery; I have to keep her
out of drafts."</p>

<p>Rosa Marie, well and becomingly clad,
would hardly have captured a prize in a
beauty show, even with very little competition.
Poor little Rosa Marie, suffering with
a severe cold, appeared a most unlovable object.
Her eyes were dull and all but invisible,
her nose and lips were red and swollen
and her wide mouth seemed even larger
than usual. The catalogue dress was more
than an accident; it was an out and out
calamity. Its gorgeous red and green plaid
was marked off like a city map in regular
squares with a startling stripe of yellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Moreover, the alarming garment was a distressingly
tight fit.</p>

<p>"It looked," sighed Mrs. Crane, apologetically,
"as pretty as you please in that book;
but of course nobody would <i>think</i> of buying
such goods as that <i>outside</i> a catalogue. But
Rosa Marie liked it."</p>

<p>After the first glance, however, the Cottagers
did not look at Rosa Marie or the
hideous plaid. They gazed instead at Henrietta's
speaking countenance. Having led
their new friend to expect something entirely
different in the way of infantile charms, they
wanted to enjoy her surprise; but strangely
enough they did not. It was evident that
something was wrong with their plan.</p>

<p>The bright, expectant look faded suddenly
from the sparkling black eyes. All the
animation fled swiftly from the girlish countenance.
Two large tears rolled down Henrietta's
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh," she mourned, "I was <i>so</i> lonely for
a real, dear little baby."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me," sighed penitent Jean, "we
thought you'd enjoy the joke. We saw at
once that you supposed that Rosa Marie was
an ordinary child&mdash;a nice little pink and
white creature in long clothes. It seemed
such a good chance to get even that we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was my fault," apologized Marjory.
"I <i>tried</i> to fool you. I never thought you'd
<i>care</i>."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said offended Mabel, stiffly,
"that you don't like Rosa Marie. She's
much more interesting than a common baby,
and I think, when I picked her out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't that," said Henrietta, smiling
through her tears. "You see, I had a baby
cousin in England that I just hated to leave&mdash;Oh,
the sweetest, daintiest little-girl baby&mdash;and
she'll be all grown up and gone before
I ever see her again. I simply adored that
baby."</p>

<p>"Never mind," soothed Bettie, generously.
"We've any number of real babies
at our house and three of them are small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
enough to cuddle. And even the littlest one
is big enough to be played with."</p>

<p>"What an accommodating family," said
Henrietta, wiping her eyes. "I guess
they'll make up for this remarkable infant."</p>

<p>"Rosa Marie certainly isn't looking her
best to-day," admitted Jean, "but you'll
really find her very interesting when you
know her better. But she never does appeal
to strangers&mdash;we've found <i>that</i> out."</p>

<p>"And just now," said Bettie, "she's
surely a sight; but when you've seen her in
the cunning little Indian costume that Mr.
Black bought for her you'll really like her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Henrietta, doubtfully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>A Full Afternoon</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>"NOW," said Mrs. Crane, with a note
of pride in her tone, "I want to
show you what Peter Black's been doing <i>this</i>
time. It's in the library."</p>

<p>The interested girls followed Mrs. Crane
into the cozy, book-lined room. Mr. Black's
purchases were apt to be worth seeing, for,
now that he had a family after so many
years of solitude, he was spending his money
lavishly. And he delighted in surprising his
elderly sister with unusual gifts.</p>

<p>"There," said Mrs. Crane, pointing to a
square cabinet of polished wood. "What
do you think of that! Can you guess what
it is?"</p>

<p>"I think," replied Jean, "it's a cupboard
for your very prettiest tea-cups&mdash;the ones
that are too nice to use."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think," said Marjory, "that it's a fire-proof
safe to keep Rosa Marie's plaid dress
in, so it won't set the house afire."</p>

<p>"I guess," said Bettie, "it's some sort of
a refrigerator to use on Sundays only."</p>

<p>"It looks to me," ventured Mabel, "like a
cage with a monkey in it. I've seen them in
processions, only they were fancier."</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> what it is," said Henrietta, "because
we have one like it, but ours isn't as
nice as this."</p>

<p>"Now turn your backs," requested Mrs.
Crane.</p>

<p>In another moment the girls were listening
to a delightful concert. Wonderful
music was pouring from the polished cabinet.</p>

<p>"I was the nearest right," asserted Mabel.</p>

<p>"Why!" objected Bettie, "you said it
was a monkey&mdash;monkeys don't sing."</p>

<p>"I was right, just the same. It's a hand
organ, and everybody knows that a monkey's
pretty near the same thing."</p>

<p>The girls laughed, for Mabel, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
usually wrong, always insisted obstinately
that she was right.</p>

<p>"It's a phonograph," explained Henrietta,
"and the very best one I ever heard."</p>

<p>"It's a whole brass band," breathed Bettie.</p>

<p>"I knew it was good," said Mrs. Crane,
contentedly, "for Peter refused to tell what
he paid for it."</p>

<p>It took a long time for the phonograph to
give up all that was inside its polished case,
and before the entertainment was quite over
Mr. Black came in.</p>

<p>Bettie, eager to display her new acquaintance,
hardly waited to greet him before introducing
Henrietta. It was a pleasure, as
well as a novelty, to have so attractive a
friend to present.</p>

<p>"This," said Bettie, proudly but a little
flustered, "is my hen, Frenriet&mdash;I mean, my
hen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bettie turned scarlet and stopped. The
girls shrieked with delight. Mrs. Crane
laughed till she cried. Mr. Black's roars of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
laughter drowned the phonograph's best
effort.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i> your hen," giggled Henrietta.
"Not even your chicken. This settles <i>that</i>
name&mdash;I can't risk being mistaken for any
more poultry."</p>

<p>"She's Henrietta Bedford," explained
Jean, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>"And how long," teased Mr. Black,
"have you been keeping poultry, Miss Bettykins?"</p>

<p>"About two weeks," giggled Bettie.
"She's Mrs. Slater's granddaughter."</p>

<p>"I don't like to seem inhospitable," said
Mr. Black, a few moments later, "but it's
beginning to snow, and the weather's going
to be a good deal worse before it gets any
better. If you start now, you'll be home
before the snow begins to drift&mdash;there's a
strong north wind and the thermometer's a
bit down-hearted."</p>

<p>The girls had removed their wraps and it
took time to get into them. Also, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Crane, noticing that the girls were dressed
for mild weather, detained them while she
hunted up a silk handkerchief to wrap about
Marjory's throat, a veil to tie over Bettie's
ears and some warmer gloves for Jean.
Henrietta and Mabel refused to be bundled
up.</p>

<p>The outside air was many degrees colder
than it had been two hours earlier, and was
full of flying snow. The wind came in
gusts, yet there was something bracing and
stimulating about the stirring atmosphere,
particularly to Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried she, "this is fine! Why
can't we take a long walk? It's a shame to
hurry home. I just love this. Isn't there
somebody we can go to see? Hasn't anybody
an errand?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," said Mabel, doubtfully. "We
could go down to Mrs. Malony's. Mother
told me this morning to get her bill, and I
forgot all about it."</p>

<p>"Mabel always has a few forgotten errands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
laid away," teased Marjory. "She
can show you, too, where she found Rosa
Marie&mdash;it's down that way."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Henrietta, making a comical
grimace, "that there's no danger of finding
any more like her. But let's go. It's a
shame to miss any of this."</p>

<p>Going down the long hill toward Mrs.
Malony's was entirely delightful, for the
wind, of which there was a great deal, was
at their well-protected backs; they fairly
scudded before it, laughing joyously as they
were swept along almost on a run. Going
westward at the bottom of the hill was not
so very bad either, for here the road was
somewhat sheltered, though the snow was
much deeper than the girls had expected to
find it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Malony, the garrulous egg-woman,
was at home; she expressed her surprise and
delight at the advent of so many unexpected
visitors.</p>

<p>"'Tis mesilf thot's glad to see so manny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
purty faces," said she, flying about to find
chairs. "'Tis the lovely complexion you
have to-day, Miss Jean. An' who's the little
lady wid the rosy cheek? The gran'choild
av Mrs. Lady Slater&mdash;wud ye hark to thot
now! An' how's Bettie darlin' wid all her
purty smiles? Thot's good&mdash;thot's good.
An' Miss Mabel here&mdash;sure she's the fat
wan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother," explained Mabel, with dignity,
"would like her egg-bill."</p>

<p>"Bill, is ut?" replied Mrs. Malony, graciously.
"Sure there's no hurry at all, at all.
The sooner it comes the sooner 'tis spint.
Ah, well, if you're afther insistin' [no one
<i>had</i> insisted] joost count the banes in me
owld taypot. Ivery wan stands fer wan
dozen eggs at twinty-foive cints the dozen."</p>

<p>"Thirteen beans," announced Jean, who
had counted them several times to make
certain.</p>

<p>"Sure," persuaded smooth-tongued Mrs.
Malony, "you'd best be takin' wan more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
dozen, Miss Mabel. 'Twould be sore unlucky
to stop wid t'irteen."</p>

<p>While she was counting the eggs, Mr.
Malony, redolent of the stable and bearing
two steaming pails of milk, came into the
kitchen. Mrs. Malony, beaming with hospitality,
went hastily to the cupboard, brought
forth five exceedingly thick cups, filled them
with milk and passed them to her dismayed
guests.</p>

<p>Some persons like warm milk, fresh from
the cow, with the cow-smell overshadowing
all other flavors. Mrs. Malony's visitors did
not. They were too polite to say so, however,
so there they sat, five martyrs to
courtesy, sipping the distasteful milk. It
clogged their throats, it made them feel
queerly upset inside, but still, solely out of
politeness, they continued to sip.</p>

<p>"Take bigger swallows," advised Mabel,
in a smothered whisper.</p>

<p>"I cuk&mdash;can't," breathed Bettie.</p>

<p>Mr. Malony had left the room. Presently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Mrs. Malony, in search of a basket for the
eggs, stooped to rummage in the untidy
recess beneath the cupboard. Quick as a
wink, Henrietta emptied her cup into the
original pail, but the other unfortunates were
left to struggle with their unwelcome refreshment.
Henrietta, however, gained
nothing by her trick, for the egg-woman,
discovering that her cup was empty,
promptly refilled it, much to the amusement
of the other victims.</p>

<p>Henrietta, discovering their state of mind,
was moved to defiance. Lifting her cup,
with a determined glint in her black eyes,
she drank every drop in four courageous,
continuous gulps. In a twinkling, the other
girls had imitated her example and were declining
Mrs. Malony's pressing offer of
more milk.</p>

<p>"Joost a wee sup," pleaded Mrs. Malony,
reaching for Jean's cup.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Jean, rising hastily.
"We ought to be getting home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Getting home, however, proved a different
matter from getting away from
home. After escaping Mrs. Malony's insistent
hospitality, the girls waded across the
snowy street and out toward the point to see
if Rosa Marie's home were still there. The
door hung from one hinge and snow had
drifted, and was still drifting, in at the doorway.</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked Henrietta, gazing
at the deserted house, "that Rosa Marie's
mother will ever come back?"</p>

<p>"No," returned Jean.</p>

<p>"Not to any such homely baby as that,"
declared Marjory.</p>

<p>"She <i>will</i> come back," asserted Mabel,
loyally. "She loved Rosa Marie&mdash;I saw it
in her eyes."</p>

<p>"Looks don't matter, with mothers,"
soothed Bettie. "A cat likes a homely yellow
kitten as well as a lovely white one.
And Dick has more freckles than Bob, but
Mother likes him just as well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rosa Marie's mother stood right in that
doorway," said Mabel, "and, as long as I
could see her, her eyes were stretching out
after Rosa Marie."</p>

<p>"They must have stuck out on pegs like a
lobster's," giggled Henrietta, "by the
time you reached the corner."</p>

<p>"I think you're <i>mean</i>," muttered Mabel.</p>

<p>"I repent," apologized Henrietta. "For
a moment I relapsed into Frederika, the Disguised
Duchess; but now I'm your own
kind-hearted Sallie and I wish that my toes
were as warm as my affections. Let's start
for civilization&mdash;we seem to have the world
to ourselves. Doesn't anybody else like
snow, I wonder?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>Taking a Walk</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>"PHEW!" gasped Jean, wheeling as the
north wind, sweeping round the corner,
caught her square in the face. "I don't
think much of that! It's like ice."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" groaned Marjory, "I wish I'd
stayed home."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" gulped Henrietta, "it's blowing
my skin off."</p>

<p>After that, no one had very much to say.
The girls needed their breath for other purposes.
With heads down and jackets pulled
tightly about them, they started up the long
hill with the wind in their faces. It was
not a pleasant wind. Cold and cutting, it
flung icy particles of snow against their
cheeks, nipped their unprotected ears, stung
their fingers and found the thin places in
their garments. It rushed down their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
throats when they opened their mouths to
speak, wrapped their petticoats so tightly
about them that they had to keep unwinding
themselves in order to walk at all, heaped
the whirling snow in drifts and filled the air
so full of flakes that it was only between
gusts that the houses were visible. Worst
of all, the way was very much uphill, and
Mabel, besides being short of breath, was
burdened with the basket of eggs. The
snow seemed to take a delight in piling itself
directly in front of them.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" gasped Henrietta, "I wish my
stockings were fur-lined. They thawed out
in Mrs. Malony's and now they're frozen
stiff. I don't like 'em."</p>

<p>"Mine, too," panted Mabel.</p>

<p>"And all my skirts," groaned Marjory.
"The edges are like saws and they're scraping
my knees."</p>

<p>"How do you like a real storm?" queried
Jean, steering Henrietta through a mighty
drift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so well as I thought I should," admitted
Henrietta. "I miss my blizzard
clothes."</p>

<p>The streets, when the girls finally reached
the top of the hill, were deserted. Even the
sides of the houses looked like solid walls of
snow, for the wind had hurled the big flakes
in gigantic handfuls against the buildings
until they were all nicely coated with a thick
frosting; and so, all the world was white.
And, by the time the five girls reached Jean's
house, for they finally accomplished that
difficult feat, they, too, were nicely plastered
from head to heels with the clinging snow.
They looked like animated snow men as
they piled thankfully into Mrs. Mapes's
parlor.</p>

<p>The girls themselves were warm and
glowing from the unusual exercise, but their
stockings and cotton skirts were frozen stiff.</p>

<p>"Henrietta will simply have to stay all
night," said Mrs. Mapes, discovering the
wet stockings. "I sent the coachman home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
half an hour ago for the sake of the horses.
I'll telephone Mrs. Slater that you're safe.
You other girls must go home at once and
change your clothes before they thaw. And,
Jean, you and Henrietta must get into bed
at once. I'll bring you a hot supper inside
of five minutes."</p>

<p>"That'll be fun," declared Jean, seizing
Henrietta's hand and making for the stairs.
"Good-night, girls."</p>

<p>"I guess," said Marjory, when the
Mapes's door had closed behind Bettie,
Mabel and herself, "Jean and Henrietta are
going to be great chums."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," sighed Bettie. "I like
Henrietta; but, dear me, I don't want Jean
to like her better than she does me."</p>

<p>"She won't," comforted Marjory. "Henrietta's
all right for a little while at a time,
but you're <i>always</i> nice."</p>

<p>Thanks to Mrs. Mapes's instructions,
none of the girls caught cold; but their
mothers were so afraid that they might that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
not one of them was permitted to poke her
nose out of doors the next day. To Henrietta's
delight, the drifts reached the fence
tops; and, until a huge plow, drawn by six
horses arranged in pairs, had cleared the
way, the roads were impassable. The wind,
after raging furiously all night, had quieted
down; but the snow continued to fall in big,
soft, clinging flakes, every tree and shrub
was weighted down with a heavy burden
and all the world was white. To Henrietta,
who had never before seen snow in such
abundance, it was a most pleasing spectacle.</p>

<p>Bettie, however, was sorely troubled.
There was Jean shut in with attractive Henrietta
and getting "chummier" with her
every minute. There was Bettie, a solitary
prisoner in a fuzzy red wrapper and bed
slippers, sighing for her beloved Jean. To
be sure, Bettie had brothers of assorted sizes
and complexions, but not one of them could
fill Jean's place in Bettie's troubled affections.</p>

<p>Had Bettie but known it, however, Jean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was not having an entirely comfortable day.
It happened to be one of Henrietta's "Frederika"
days. The lively girl tormented
bashful Wallace by pretending that she herself
was excessively shy, and, as shyness was
not one of her attributes, her victim was
covered with confusion. She teased and
bewildered Roger by chattering so rapidly
in French that he couldn't understand a
word she said, although he had studied the
language for three years under Miss McGinnis
and was proud of his progress. A
number of times she became so witty at
Jean's expense that "Sallie" had to rush to
the rescue with profuse apologies. Also,
she disturbed both Mr. and Mrs. Mapes by
her extreme restlessness.</p>

<p>"My sakes," confided Mrs. Mapes, in the
privacy of the kitchen, whither she had fled
for the sake of quiet, "I'm glad that girl
doesn't belong to me; she isn't still a
minute."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Roger, who had escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
on the pretext of blacking his shoes, "it's
because she has traveled so much. Maybe
she feels as if she had to keep going."</p>

<p>"Bettie's certainly a great deal quieter,"
agreed Jean, who looked tired, "and she
doesn't talk all night when a body wants to
sleep; but Henrietta's more fun. You see,
you never know what she's going to do next,
but Bettie's always just the same."</p>

<p>At dinner time that day, Mrs. Mapes
asked her husband if he knew whether the
School Board had accomplished anything at
the meeting held the night previously.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Mapes, a tall, thin
man with a preoccupied air. "And they
never will as long as each one of them wants
to put that schoolhouse in a different place.
They can't come to any sort of an agreement."</p>

<p>Indeed, the poor School Board was having
a perplexing time. The citizens that
lived at the north end of the town wanted
the new school built there. Other tax-payers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
declared that the southern portion of
Lakeville, being more densely populated,
offered a more suitable site. Then, since
the town stretched westward for a long distance,
a third group of persons were clamoring
for the building in <i>their</i> part of the town.
Besides all these, there were persons who declared
that the old site was the <i>only</i> place
for a school building. As the Board itself
was divided as to opinion, it began to look
as if Lakeville would have to get along without
a schoolhouse unless it could afford to
build four, and the tax-payers said it
couldn't do that.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Mrs. Mapes, "that I could
find a first-class girls' school within a reasonable
distance. If they don't have a proper
building in Lakeville by next September I'll
send Jean away. That Baptist cellar is
damp, and I know it. Besides, I went to a
good boarding school myself and I'd like
Jean to have the experience&mdash;I'll never forget
those days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Send her," suggested Henrietta, "to the
school I'm going to."</p>

<p>"Which one is that?" asked Mrs. Mapes.</p>

<p>"I don't know; but Grandmother says it
mustn't be too far away. She wants me
within reach."</p>

<p>"I think," said Mrs. Mapes, reflectively,
"I'll send for some catalogues."</p>

<p>The next morning the sun shone brightly
on a glittering world. Henrietta went into
ecstasies over it, for even the tree trunks
seemed incrusted with diamonds&mdash;or at least
rhine-stones, Henrietta said. The coachman
arrived with the Slater horses a little
before nine o'clock and the two girls were
carried off to school in state. They waved
their hands to Bettie as they passed her
trudging in the snow; and poor Bettie was
suddenly conscious of a sharp twinge of
jealousy.</p>

<p>Now that Henrietta had been properly
called on and had returned the call, she became
a permanent part of all the Cottagers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
plans. Thereafter, there was hardly a day
when one or another of the four girls did
not see the fascinating maid of many names.
They always found her interesting, attractive
and entertaining. Yet, there were days
when she teased them almost to the limit of
their endurance, times when they could not
quite approve her and moments when she
fairly roused them to anger; but, in spite of
her faults, they could not help loving her,
because, with all her impishness and her
distressing lack of repose, she was warm-hearted,
loyal and thoroughly true. And,
although she possessed dozens of advantages
that the other girls lacked, although she was
beautifully gowned, splendidly housed and
bountifully supplied with spending money,
never did she show, in any way, the faintest
scrap of false pride. She mentioned her life
abroad, in a simple, matter-of-fact way (as
if it were a mere incident that might have
happened to anybody), but never in any
boasting spirit. Her prankishness, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
kept her from being too good or too
lovable; for, as her Grandmother said, she
spared no one; sometimes even Jean, who
was a model of patience, found it hard to
forgive fun-loving Frederika, the Disguised
Duchess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>The Statue from India</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>ALL the shops in Lakeville wore a holiday
air, for money was plentiful and
trade was unusually brisk. The windows
were gay with wreaths of holly and glittering
strings of Christmas-tree ornaments.
Clerks were busy and smiling. Customers,
alert for bargains, crowded about the counters
and parted cheerfully from their cash.
Persons in the streets, laden with parcels of
every shape, size and color, pushed eagerly
through the doors or hurried along the busy
thoroughfares. All wore an air of eager
expectancy, for two weeks of December
were gone and Christmas was fairly scrambling
into sight.</p>

<p>The five girls had money to spend. Very
little of it, to be sure, belonged to the Cottagers;
but Henrietta had a great deal, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
as they all went together on their shopping
expeditions, it didn't matter very much, as
far as enjoyment went, who did the purchasing.
Bettie said that it was quite as much
fun to help Henrietta pick out a five-dollar
scarf pin for Simmons, the butler, as it was
to choose ten-cent paper weights for Bob
and Dick. Besides, no one was obliged to
go home empty-handed, because it took all
five to carry Henrietta's purchases.</p>

<p>All five were making things besides.
Sometimes they sewed at Jean's, sometimes
at Henrietta's, occasionally at Marjory's and
once in a while at Mabel's. They liked least
of all to go to Marjory's because Aunty
Jane, who was a wonderfully particular
housekeeper, objected to their walking on
her hardwood floors and seemed equally
averse to having them step on the rugs. As
they couldn't very well use the ceiling or feel
entirely comfortable under the battery of
Aunty Jane's disapproving glances, they
liked to go where they were more warmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
welcomed. Perhaps Henrietta's once-dreaded
home was the most popular place,
though in that fascinating abode they could
not accomplish a great deal in the sewing
line because Henrietta invariably produced
such a bewildering array of unusual belongings
to show them that their eyes kept busier
than their fingers. In another way, however,
they accomplished a great deal. Henrietta,
who was really very clever with her
needle, had started at one time or another a
great many different articles. These, in
their half-finished condition&mdash;the changeable
girl was much better at beginning things
than at completing them&mdash;she lavishly bestowed
on her friends. Lovely flowered
ribbons, dainty bits of silk and lace, curious
scraps of Japanese and Chinese embroidery,
embossed leather and rich brocades, all these
found their way into the Cottagers' work-bags.</p>

<p>Out of these fascinating odds and ends
they fashioned gifts for Mrs. Crane, Anne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Halliday's mother, their out-of-town relatives,
their parents and their school-teachers.
They wanted, of course, to buy every toy
that ever was made for Rosa Marie, little
Anne Halliday, Peter Tucker and the Marcotte
twins; but Mr. Black, meeting them in
the toy-shop one day, implored them to leave
just a few things in the shops for him to
buy, particularly for Rosa Marie and little
Peter Tucker, his namesake.</p>

<p>And now, Mabel was immensely pleased
with Henrietta; for, one day, Rosa Marie,
cured of her cold, had been dressed in her
cunning little Indian costume for the new
girl's benefit. Rosa Marie had looked so
very much more attractive than when she
had had a cold that Henrietta had been
greatly taken with her. As the way to
Mabel's affections was through approval of
Rosa Marie, Henrietta quickly found it, so
the threatened breach was healed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Crane," Henrietta had cried,
on beholding the little brown person in buckskin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and feathers, "do let me telephone for
James to bring the carriage so I can take
Rosa Marie to our house and show her to
my Grandmother. I'll take the very best of
care of her. And all four of the girls can
come with her, so she won't be afraid."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i>," pleaded the others.</p>

<p>"Well, it's mild out to-day," returned
Mrs. Crane, glancing out the window, "and
a little fresh air won't hurt her. I guess her
coat will go on right over these fixings and
I can tie a veil over her head. You'll find a
telephone in the library, on Mr. Black's
desk."</p>

<p>Half an hour later, the six youngsters,
carefully tucked between splendid fur robes,
were on their way to Mrs. Slater's.</p>

<p>"I have a perfectly heavenly plan," said
Henrietta, her black eyes sparkling with
impishness. "Want to hear it?"</p>

<p>"Of course we do," encouraged the Cottagers.</p>

<p>"You see," explained Henrietta, "a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
box came from Father this morning. It
hasn't been opened yet; but Greta and Simmons
don't know that. I'm going to make
them think that Rosa Marie is what came in
that box&mdash;it's time I cheered them up a little,
for Simmons has lost some money he had in
the bank and Greta is homesick for the old
country. Will you help?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," promised Jean, doubtfully, "if
you're not going to hurt anybody's feelings."</p>

<p>"Shan't even scratch one," assured Henrietta.
"Now, when we reach the house,
I'll slip around to the basement door with
Rosa Marie&mdash;the cook will let us in&mdash;and
you must ring the front-door bell because
that will take Simmons out of the way while
I get up the back stairs. Ask for Grandmother,
and I'll come down and get you
when I'm ready."</p>

<p>So the girls asked for Mrs. Slater&mdash;every
one of them now liked the entertaining old
lady very much indeed&mdash;and chatted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
her merrily until Henrietta came running
down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Grannie," asked the lively girl, pressing
her warm red cheek against Mrs. Slater's
much paler one, "would you like to be
amused? Would you like to be a black
conspirator and humble your most haughty
servitor to the dust? Then you must ascend
to my haunted den and not say a single
word for at least five minutes. Come on,
girls."</p>

<p>In Henrietta's oddly furnished room there
were two large East Indian gods and one
heathen goddess. Henrietta had managed
to group these interesting, Oriental figures
in one corner of the spacious chamber, with
appropriate drapings behind them. Near
them she had placed an empty packing case,
oblong in shape and plastered with curious,
foreign labels. It looked as if it were waiting
to be carried away to the furnace room
or some such place.</p>

<p>Darkening her bedroom and her dressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
room, she placed her obliging grandmother
and her four friends behind the heavy
portières.</p>

<p>"You can peek round the edges," said she,
"but you mustn't be seen or heard or even
suspected."</p>

<p>Then, fun-loving Henrietta brought Rosa
Marie from another room, removed her
wraps, concealed them from sight and placed
the stolid child in a sitting posture on a large
tabouret near one of the richly colored
statues. Next she rang for Greta, and ran
downstairs in person to ask Simmons to
come at once to remove the heavy packing
case.</p>

<p>Simmons obeyed immediately and just as
the pair reached Henrietta's door, Greta,
who had been in her own room, joined them.
All three entered together.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to see my lovely new
statue?" asked Henrietta. "There, with
the rest of my heathen friends."</p>

<p>"Ho," said Simmons, leaning closer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
look. "<i>That's</i> wot came in that 'eavy box.
Another 'eathen god from Hindia."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i0258.jpg" width="310" height="500" alt="maid and butler looking at baby in native costume" />
<div class="caption">"ANOTHER 'EATHEN GOD FROM HINDIA."</div>
</div>

<p>"He ees very pretty god-lady, Miss Henrietta,"
approved Greta. "Looks most like
real."</p>

<p>Rosa Marie, awed by her strange surroundings,
played her part most beautifully.
For a long moment she sat perfectly still.
But, just as Simmons leaned forward to take
a better look at her, Rosa Marie, who had
suddenly caught a whiff of pungent smoke
from the joss-sticks that Henrietta had
lighted to create a proper atmosphere for
her gods and goddesses, gave a sudden
sneeze. The effect was all that could be
desired. Simmons leaped backward and
Greta, who was excitable, gave a piercing
shriek.</p>

<p>The hidden girls restrained their giggles,
but only with difficulty; and Bettie said
afterwards that she could feel Mrs. Slater
shaking with helpless laughter.</p>

<p>"My heye!" exclaimed Simmons, "wot'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
they be mykin' next! Look! Hit's movin'
'is 'ead."</p>

<p>Rosa Marie proceeded deliberately to
move more than her head. Putting both
hands on the tabouret, she managed somehow
to lift herself clumsily to all-fours,
balancing uncertainly for several moments
in that ungainly attitude. Then she rose to
her feet, and, stiffly, like some mechanical
toy, stretched out her arms toward Henrietta.
Greta backed hastily through the
doorway; but Simmons eyed the swaying
youngster with enlightened eyes.</p>

<p>"Hit's a real biby, from Hindia," said he,
"but think of hit comin' hall that wy in that
there box. But them Indoos 'ave a lot of
queer tricks and Hi suppose they drugged
'im, mide a bloomin' mummy of 'im and sent
directions for bringin' of 'im to."</p>

<p>"Take the box downstairs, please," said
Henrietta, succeeding in the difficult task of
keeping her face straight. "This is a little
North Indian from Lakeville, Simmons, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
an East Indian from India, and it was only
some things that I'm not to look at till Christmas
that came in the box."</p>

<p>"Hi <i>thought</i> hit was mighty stringe," returned
Simmons, looking very much relieved
and not at all resentful. "Hit seemed
sort of hawful, Miss 'Enrietta, to think as
'ow 'uman bein's could tike such chances
with heven their hown hoffsprings. But,
just the sime, Miss 'Enrietta, Hi've 'eard of
them 'Indoos doing mighty queer things,
and Hi, for one, don't trust 'em."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>Comparing Notes</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IT was eight o'clock, the morning of the
twenty-fourth day of December, which
is twice as exciting a day as the twenty-fifth
and at least ten times as interesting as the
twenty-sixth.</p>

<p>Bettie, and as many of the little Tuckers
as had been able to find enough clothes for
decency, were eating pancakes a great deal
faster than Mrs. Tucker could bake them
over the Rectory stove. Marjory, her young
countenance somewhat puckered because of
the tartness of her grapefruit, was sitting
sedately opposite her Aunty Jane. Jean had
finished her breakfast and was tying mysterious
tissue paper parcels with narrow
scarlet ribbon; and Mabel, having suddenly
remembered that this was the day that the
postman brought interesting mail, was hurrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
with might and main to get into her
sailor blouse in order to capture the letters.
Of course she didn't expect to open any of
her Christmas mail; but she did like to
squeeze the packages. Henrietta was reading
a long, delightful letter from her father.
Mrs. Slater, too, had Christmas letters.</p>

<p>Five blocks away Mr. Black and Mrs.
Crane were finishing their breakfast. Their
dining-room was at the back of the house,
where its three broad windows commanded
a fine view of the lake. Just at the top of
the bluff and well inside the Black-Crane
yard stood a wonderfully handsome fir tree,
a truly splendid tree, for in all Lakeville there
was no other evergreen to compare with it in
size, shape or color.</p>

<p>Every now and again, Mr. Black would
turn in his chair to gaze earnestly out the
window at the tree. For a long time, Mrs.
Crane, her nice dark eyes dancing with fun,
watched her brother in silence. But when
he began to consume the last quarter of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
second piece of toast she felt that it was time
to speak.</p>

<p>"Peter," said she, "you can't do it."</p>

<p>"Do what?" asked Mr. Black, with a
guilty start.</p>

<p>"Cut down that tree. I know, just as
well as I know anything, that you're just
aching to make that splendid big evergreen
into a Christmas-tree for Rosa Marie and
those four girls."</p>

<p>"<i>How</i> do you know it?" queried Mr.
Black, eying his sister with quick suspicion.</p>

<p>"Because I had the same thought myself.
It <i>would</i> be fine for Christmas&mdash;it looks like
a Christmas-tree every day of the year.
And if you've been a sort of bottled-up
Santa Claus all your life you're apt to be
pretty foolish when you're finally unbottled.
And that tree&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," queried Mr. Black, "what would
it be the day after?"</p>

<p>"That," confessed Mrs. Crane, "is what
bothers <i>me</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"It does seem a shame," said Mr. Black,
rising and walking to the window, "to cut
down such a perfect specimen as that; and
yet, in all my life I never met a tree so evidently
designed for the express purpose of
serving as a Christmas-tree. It's a real
temptation."</p>

<p>"I know it," sighed Mrs. Crane. "It's
been tempting <i>me</i>; but I said: 'Get thee behind
me, Santa Claus, and send me to the
proper place for Christmas-trees.'"</p>

<p>"And did you go to that place?"</p>

<p>"It came to me. I engaged a twelve-foot
tree from a man that was taking orders
at the door."</p>

<p>"So did I," confessed Mr. Black. "I'm
not sure that I didn't order two."</p>

<p>"Peter Black! You're spoiling those
children."</p>

<p>"I'm having plenty of help," twinkled
Mr. Black, shrewdly.</p>

<p>With so many trees to choose from, it
certainly seemed probable that the Black-Crane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
household would have at least one
respectable specimen to decorate; but half
an hour later, when the three ordered balsams
arrived, both Mr. Black and Mrs.
Crane were greatly disappointed. The trees
had shrunk from twelve to six feet, and the
uneven branches were thin and sparsely
covered.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Mr. Black, "all three
of those trees together wouldn't make a
whole tree."</p>

<p>"They look," said Mrs. Crane, "as if
they were shedding their feathers."</p>

<p>"Most of them," agreed Mr. Black,
"have already been shed. I said, Mr. Man,
that I wanted <i>good</i> trees."</p>

<p>"My wagon broke down," explained the
tree-man, "so I couldn't bring anything that
I couldn't haul on a big sled. They weigh a
lot, those big fellows."</p>

<p>"Can't you make a special trip," suggested
Mrs. Crane, "and bring us a first-class
tree&mdash;just one?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's too late. I have to go too far before
I'm allowed to cut any."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Black, "I'll pay you for
these, and I'll give you fifty cents extra to
haul them off the premises. We don't want
any such sorrowful specimens round here to
cast a gloom over our Christmas, do we,
Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Peter," announced Mrs. Crane, when
the man had departed with his scraggly
trees, "I have an idea. The weather's
likely to stay mild for another twenty-four
hours, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"And this is an honest town?"</p>

<p>"As honest as they make 'em."</p>

<p>"And all those girls are accustomed to
being outdoors&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <i>see</i>!" cried Mr. Black, giving Mrs.
Crane's plump shoulders a sudden, friendly
whack. "I <i>almost</i> thought of that myself.
We'll certainly surprise 'em <i>this</i> time."</p>

<p>Although it was getting late, Mr. Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
still hung about the house as if he had not
yet freed his mind of Christmas matters.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mr. Black, breaking a
long silence, "that you've thought of a few
things to put on the tree for those girls?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Mrs. Crane, guardedly,
"I've gathered up some little fixings that I
thought they'd fancy."</p>

<p>"It might be a good idea," said Mr. Black,
rising to ring for Martin, "for us to compare
notes. Two heads are better than one,
you know; and after what they did for us,
we owe those little folks a splendid Christmas."</p>

<p>"We certainly do," agreed Mrs. Crane,
wiping away the sudden moisture that
sprung to her eyes at thought of the memorable
dinner party in Dandelion Cottage&mdash;the
dinner that had brought her estranged
brother to the rescue. "I don't know where
I'd have been now if it hadn't been for those
blessed children. In the poorhouse, probably."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Martin," said Mr. Black, huskily, "you
go to the storeroom in the basement. Take
a hatchet with you and knock the top off that
wooden box that is marked with a big blue
cross and bring it up here to me."</p>

<p>Presently Martin, who always blundered
if there was the very faintest excuse for
blundering, returned, proudly bearing the
cover of the large box.</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Mr. Black, turning
twinkling eyes upon Mrs. Crane, who
twinkled back. "Now bring up the box
with all the things in it."</p>

<p>"I'll get my things, too," offered Mrs.
Crane. "They're right here in the library
closet, in a clothes hamper."</p>

<p>Then when Martin had brought the box,
the two middle-aged people began to sort
their presents. They went about it rather
awkwardly because neither had had much
experience; but they were certainly enjoying
their novel occupation.</p>

<p>"This," said Mr. Black, clearing a space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
on the big library table, "is Bettie's pile, and
Heaven knows that I tried not to get it bigger
than the other three; but everything I
saw in the shops shouted 'Buy me for Bettie'&mdash;and
I usually obeyed."</p>

<p>"This is Jean's pile," said Mrs. Crane,
baring another space, "and I guess I feel
about Jean the way you do about Bettie; but
I love Bettie too&mdash;and all of them. Rosa
Marie's things will have to go on the floor&mdash;they're
mostly bumpy and breakable."</p>

<p>Mr. Black rummaged in his box, Mrs.
Crane fished in her basket. Presently there
was a rapidly growing, untidy heap of large,
lumpy bundles on the floor for Rosa Marie,
and four very neat stacks of square, compact
parcels for the Cottagers.</p>

<p>"Let's open them all," suggested Mr.
Black, eagerly. "We can tie them up
again."</p>

<p>So the elderly couple, as interested as two
children, opened their packages. At first,
both were too busy renewing acquaintanceship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
with their own purchases to notice what
the other was doing; but presently Mrs.
Crane gave a start as her eye traveled over
the table.</p>

<p>"Why, Peter Black," she exclaimed.
"Here are two watches in Bettie's pile!"</p>

<p>"I didn't buy but one of them," declared
Mr. Black, placing his finger on one of the
dainty timepieces. "That's mine."</p>

<p>"The other's mine," confessed Mrs.
Crane. "And, Peter, did you go and buy
dolls all around, too?"</p>

<p>"I did," owned Mr. Black, opening a
long narrow box. "One <i>always</i> buys dolls
for Christmas."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Mrs. Crane, "I guess
they can stand two apiece, because ours are
not a bit alike. You see, you got carried
away by fine clothes and I paid more attention
to the dolls themselves. The bodies are
first-class and the faces are lovely. I bought
mine undressed and I've had four weeks'
pleasure dressing them&mdash;I sort of hate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
give them up. The clothes are plain and
substantial; I couldn't make 'em fancy."</p>

<p>"But the watches, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we'll have to send half of
those watches back. Yours are the nicest&mdash;we'll
keep yours."</p>

<p>"I suspect," said Mr. Black, reflectively
pinching two large parcels in Rosa Marie's
heap, "that we've both bought Teddy bears
for Rosa Marie. And we've both supplied
the girls with perfume, purses and writing
paper, but I don't see any books."</p>

<p>"We'll use the extra-watch money for
books," decided Mrs. Crane, promptly.
"Suppose you attend to that&mdash;if we both do
it we'll have another double supply. I see
we've both bought candy, too; but I need a
box for the milk-boy and I'd like to send
some little thing to Martin's small sister."</p>

<p>"On the whole," said Mr. Black, complacently,
"we've managed pretty well considering
our inexperience; but next time
we'll do better."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>Christmas Eve</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IN Lakeville, Christmas always began at
exactly four o'clock the afternoon of the
twenty-fourth; for the young people of that
little town&mdash;even the very old young people
with gray hair and youthful eyes&mdash;always
indulged in an unusual and extremely enjoyable
custom. The moment that marked this
real beginning of Christmas found each
person with gifts for her neighbor sallying
forth with a great basketful of parcels on
her arm. If one had a great many friends
and neighbors it often took until ten o'clock
at night to distribute all one's gifts. As
each package was wrapped in white tissue
paper, tied with ribbon and further adorned
with sprigs of holly or gay Christmas cards,
these Christmas baskets were decidedly attractive;
and the streets of Lakeville, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
four to ten, were certain to be full of gayety
and genuine Christmas cheer.</p>

<p>On all other days of the year, the Cottagers
traveled together; but on this occasion
each girl was an entirely separate person.
Bettie, wearing a fine air of importance,
went alone to Mabel's, to Jean's and
to Marjory's to leave her gifts for her three
friends. Although, at all other times, it was
her habit to run in unceremoniously, to-day
she rang each door-bell and was formally admitted
to each front hall, where she selected
the package designed for each house. Jean
and the other two, likewise, went forth by
themselves to leave their mysterious little
parcels. But when this rite was completed
all four ran to their own homes, added more
parcels to their gay baskets and then congregated
in Mrs. Mapes's parlor.</p>

<p>They had gifts for dear little Anne Halliday,
the Marcotte twins, Henrietta Bedford,
Rosa Marie, Mr. Black, Mrs. Crane, some
distant cousins of Jean's and for all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
school-teachers that had not gone out of
town for the holidays. Besides, their
parents had intrusted them with articles to
be delivered to their friends and Mabel had
a gift for the dust-chute Janitor, a silver
match-safe with the date of the fire engraved
under his initials.</p>

<p>"We'll go to Henrietta's first," decided
Jean, "because that's the farthest."</p>

<p>"And to the Janitor's next," said Mabel,
"because I want to get it over and forget
about it."</p>

<p>To make things more exciting for Henrietta,
the girls went in singly to present
their offerings, the others crouching out of
sight behind the stone balustrades that
flanked the steps. Each time the bell rang,
Henrietta was right at Simmons's heels when
he opened the door. Then, after a brief
wait outside, all four again presented themselves
to invite Henrietta, who had gifts for
Rosa Marie, to go with them to Mr. Black's
and all the other places. Henrietta was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to go, because she herself was too new to
Lakeville to have very many friends to favor
with presents. The five had a very merry
time with their baskets; but they were much
too excited to stay a great while under any
one roof. They shouted merry greetings to
the rest of the basket-laden population and
paused more than once to obligingly pull a
door-bell for some elderly acquaintance who
found that she needed more hands than she
had started out with.</p>

<p>"How jolly everybody is!" remarked
Henrietta. "I never saw a more Christmassy
lot of people. It must be lovely to
have a long, long list to give to."</p>

<p>"Father says this is an unusually nice
town," offered Bettie. "The people seem
actually glad to have folks sick and in trouble
so they can send them flowers and things to
eat."</p>

<p>"What a charitable place," laughed
Henrietta, gaily. "I hope nobody's longing
for <i>me</i> to come down with anything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
I'd rather stay well than eat flowers&mdash;they're
too expensive just now."</p>

<p>"My!" exclaimed Mabel, after all the
gifts had been distributed and the girls, with
their empty baskets turned over their heads,
had started homeward, "won't to-morrow
be a lively day. First, all our stockings; very
early in the morning at home. Next, all our
Christmas packages to open&mdash;I've about ten
already that I haven't even squeezed&mdash;that
is, not <i>very</i> hard, except one that I know is a
bottle. Then our dinners&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too bad we can't have all our dinners
together," mourned Marjory, "but of course
your mothers and my Aunty Jane and Henrietta's
grandmother would be too lonely if
we did; and all the families in a bunch would
make too many to feed comfortably."</p>

<p>"And then," proceeded Mabel, "a tree at
Mr. Black's just as soon as it's dark enough
to light the candles, and supper and another
tree at Henrietta's in the evening, and a ride
home in the Slater carriage afterwards, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
by that time we'll surely be too tired to
walk."</p>

<p>"And I've trimmed a tree for the boys at
home," said Bettie. "There won't be anything
on it for you, but you can all come to
see it."</p>

<p>"Aunty Jane says that Christmas-trees
shed their feathers and make too much litter,"
said Marjory, "but with three others
to visit I don't mind if I don't have one."</p>

<p>"You can have half of mine," offered
Mabel, generously. "I shan't have time to
trim more than half of it, anyway, so I'd
like somebody to help."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Marjory, doubtfully,
"that we ought to do something for the
poor, but I don't know where to find any
since our washwoman married the butcher."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you don't," laughed Henrietta.
"I've nine cents left and it's got to last, for
I shan't have any more until I get my allowance
the first of January, unless somebody
sends me money for Christmas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess," giggled Jean, fishing an empty
purse from her pocket, "the rest of us
couldn't scare up nine cents between us; but
I have an uncle who always sends me a paper
dollar every year. I've spent it in at least
fifty different ways already. I always have
lovely times with that dollar <i>before</i> it comes,
but it just sort of melts away into nothing
afterwards."</p>

<p>"I wish," breathed Mabel, fervently, "<i>I</i>
had an uncle like that."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Henrietta, "a few uncles
with the paper-dollar habit wouldn't be bad
things to have."</p>

<p>"I caught a glimpse of your tree, Henrietta,"
confessed Marjory. "I stood on
the balustrade outside and peeked in the window
when Jean was inside. It's going to be
perfectly grand; but of course I didn't <i>mean</i>
to peek. I just got up there because I was
too excited to stay on the ground."</p>

<p>"So did I," owned Bettie.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Mabel, "where Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Black's tree is. We were in all the downstairs
rooms and I didn't see a sign of it."</p>

<p>"Probably," teased Henrietta, "he's forgotten
to order one. Unless one forms the
habit very early in life, one is very apt to
overlook little things like that."</p>

<p>"Mr. Black never forgets," assured Bettie.</p>

<p>"Probably it's some place in the yard,"
ventured Marjory, not guessing how close
she came to the truth.</p>

<p>"No," declared Mabel, positively. "I
looked out the windows and there wasn't a
single sign of a tree anywhere. I pretty
nearly asked about it, but I wasn't sure that
that would be polite."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," soothed Jean. "There'll
<i>be</i> one if Mr. Black has to plant a seed and
grow it over night. He and Mrs. Crane are
more excited over Christmas than we are.
They can't think of anything else."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>A Crowded Day</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>MABEL rose very early indeed on
Christmas morning to explore her
bulging stocking and to open her packages;
but Mr. Black and Mrs. Crane were even
earlier, and they were delighted to find that
the weather had remained mild. Putting on
their outside wraps and warm overshoes, the
worthy couple went with good-natured Martin
and Maggie, the nimble nursery maid, to
the garden as soon as it was light. They
strung the tall tree from top to bottom with
tinsel and glittering Christmas-tree ornaments,
the finest that money could buy.
Martin and the maid, perched on tall step-ladders,
worked enthusiastically. Mr. Black
and Mrs. Crane handed up the decorations.
The cook, watching them from the basement
window, grinned broadly at the sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure," said she, "'tis a lot of children
they are; but 'twould do no harrum if all the
wurruld was loike 'em."</p>

<p>By church time the towering tree was in
readiness except for a few of the more precious
gifts, to be added later.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Mrs. Crane, with a lingering,
backward glance, when there was no
further excuse for remaining outdoors,
"that the air will be as quiet to-night as it
is now. It would be dreadful if we couldn't
light the candles."</p>

<p>"We'll have to trust to luck," returned
Mr. Black, "but I'm quite sure that luck will
be with us."</p>

<p>Of course the girls enjoyed their stockings
at home, their gifts that arrived by mail
and express from out-of-town relatives and
the bountiful dinners at the home tables.
But the Black-Crane tree to which Henrietta,
likewise, had been invited, was something
entirely new and so proved particularly enjoyable;
if not, indeed, the crowning event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of the day. Martin had cleared away the
snow and had laid boards and even a carpet
for them to stand on, and there were chairs
and extra wraps, only the girls were too excited
to use them. But Mrs. Crane and
placid Rosa Marie sat enveloped in steamer
rugs while the others capered about the brilliantly
lighted tree, constantly discovering
new beauties.</p>

<p>"I declare," sighed Mrs. Crane, happily,
"you're the youngest of the lot, Peter."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Mr. Black, "why not?
It's the first real Christmas I've had for forty
years&mdash;but let's have another Christmas dinner
on New Year's Day; I was disappointed
when all these young folks said, 'No, thank
you,' to our invitation to dinner. Just remember,
girls, we expect to see you all here
the first of January or there'll be trouble&mdash;I'll
see that it lasts all the year, too."</p>

<p>"Peter Black," warned Mrs. Crane, "that
step-ladder's prancing on one leg. If you
go over that bluff you won't stop till you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
land in the lake. Let Martin do all the
circus acts."</p>

<p>"I've got it, now," said Mr. Black, coming
down safely with the small parcel that
had dangled so long just above his reach.
"Here's something for Henrietta Bedford,
with the tree's compliments."</p>

<p>"How nice of you to remember me,"
cried Henrietta, opening the parcel. "And
what a dear little pin&mdash;just what I needed.
Thank you very much indeed."</p>

<p>Of all their gifts, however, the Cottagers
liked their lovely little watches the best.
They had expected no such magnificent gifts
from Mr. Black, and their own people had,
of course, considered them much too young
to be trusted with watches.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mabel, strutting about
with her timepiece pinned to her blouse, "I
feel too grown-upedy for words. I never
expected this moment to come."</p>

<p>"I've <i>always</i> wanted a watch," breathed
Jean, "but I certainly supposed I'd have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
wait until I'd graduated from high-school&mdash;folks
almost always get them then."</p>

<p>"And I," beamed Marjory, "never expected
a <i>pretty</i>, really truly girl's watch, because&mdash;worse
luck&mdash;I'm to get Aunty Jane's
awful watch when she dies. Of course I don't
want her to die a minute before her time, but
getting even <i>that</i> watch seemed sort of hopeless
because all Aunty Jane's ancestors that
weren't killed by accident lived to enjoy their
nineties. But that doesn't prevent Aunty
Jane's promising me that clumsy old turnip
whenever she's particularly pleased with
me."</p>

<p>Bettie was too delighted for speech. But
her big brown eyes spoke eloquently for her.</p>

<p>Rosa Marie accepted the unusual tree, all
her Teddy bears, her dolls and other gifts,
very much as a matter of course. Nothing
it appeared was ever sufficiently surprising
to astonish calm little Rosa Marie.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," offered Bettie, "she's awfully
surprised inside."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know <i>I</i> am," laughed Mabel. "Inside
and out, too."</p>

<p>Then, just as Mrs. Crane had decided that
Rosa Marie had been outdoors long enough,
the Slater carriage arrived for the girls.
Mr. Black, beaming at the success of his
Christmas party, packed them with all their
belongings into the vehicle and they rolled
happily away.</p>

<p>They stopped at their own homes just
long enough to drop most of the gifts they
had garnered from the Black-Crane tree;
and then Henrietta whisked her friends to
the Slater home, where Mrs. Slater entertained
them for two hours over a delightful,
genuinely English Christmas supper.</p>

<p>Henrietta's tree, too, was a very handsome
one. A realistic Santa Claus who seemed
as English as the supper, since he dropped
the letter H just as Simmons always did,
distributed the gifts. When the Cottagers
opened odd, foreign-looking parcels and
found that Henrietta had given each girl a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
set of three beautiful Oriental boxes with
jewelled tops, their delight knew no bounds.
They had expected nothing so fine.</p>

<p>"You see," explained Henrietta, "I told
Father, months ago, to send me a lot of little
things to give away for Christmas and of
course he bought boxes. I believe he buys
every one he sees."</p>

<p>"They're darlings," declared Jean,
dreamily. "They take you away to far-off
places where things smell old and&mdash;and
magnificent."</p>

<p>"It's the grown-upness of my presents
that I like," explained eleven-year-old
Mabel, with a big sigh of satisfaction. "It's
lovely to have people treat you as if you were
somebody."</p>

<p>"You see," laughed Marjory, "it's only
two years ago that an absent-minded aunt
of Mr. Bennett's sent Mabel a rattle, and the
poor child can't forget it."</p>

<p>"Miss 'Enrietta," inquired Santa Claus,
anxiously, when the Slater tree, too, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
stripped of all but its decorations, "might
Hi be hexcused now? Hi'm due at a Christmas
ball and Hi'm hawfully afride these
togs is meltin' me 'igh collar."</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Henrietta, "you've done
nobly and I hope you'll have a lovely time at
the party."</p>

<p>It was half-past ten before the Cottagers
got to bed that night&mdash;a long day because
they had risen so early.</p>

<p>"But," breathed Bettie, happily, "when
days are as nice as this I like 'em long."</p>

<p>"It's nice to have friends," said Jean.</p>

<p>"I wish," sighed Mabel, "they'd make
some kind of a watch that had to be wound
every hour; it seems awfully hard to wait
until morning."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Bennett looked in that night
to see if Mabel had remembered to take off
her best hair ribbon, she found a doll on each
side of the blissful slumberer, a watch pinned
to her nightdress, a jeweled box clasped
loosely in each relaxed hand and at least half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
a bushel of other treasures under the uncomfortable
pillow. As Mrs. Bennett gently
removed all these articles and straightened
the bed-clothes Mabel murmured in her sleep,
"Merry Christmas, girls."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>A Bettie-less Plan</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE first thing that happened after
Christmas was the announcement of
the School Board's decision to wait a full
year before beginning to build a new schoolhouse.</p>

<p>"Even if we could decide on a site," said
they, "it would be hard on the tax-payers
to furnish money for such a building all at
one assessment. By spreading it over two
years' tax-rolls it will come easier."</p>

<p>The fathers, for the most part, were
pleased with the arrangement, but many of
the mothers disliked it very much indeed.</p>

<p>"We must do something about it," said
Aunty Jane, who had called at Mrs. Bennett's
to talk the matter over. "I'm in
favor of sending Marjory away to some
good girls' school, because she has some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
money that is to be used solely for educational
purposes. There is enough for college
and for at least one year at a boarding school,
besides something for extras. My conscience
will feel easier when that money begins
to go toward its proper purpose."</p>

<p>"The Doctor thinks of going to Germany
next fall for a special course of study that he
thinks he needs," returned Mrs. Bennett.
"If we could place Mabel in a safe, comfortable
school, I could go with him. We've
been talking of it for a long time."</p>

<p>"I certainly am not satisfied," admitted
Mrs. Mapes, when Aunty Jane put the matter
to her. "There are too many pupils
crowded into that Baptist basement and it's
so damp that I've had to put cold compresses
on Jean's throat four times since the fire. If
you can find a good school to fit a modest
pocketbook we'd be glad to send Jean for
the one year."</p>

<p>Then Aunty Jane unfolded her plans to
the Tuckers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a beautiful idea," said pleasant Dr.
Tucker, "as far as the rest of you are concerned;
but you will have to leave Bettie
entirely out of the scheme; we simply can't
afford it. We've always hoped to be able
to do something for Dick&mdash;he wants to be a
physician&mdash;but even that is hopelessly beyond
us at present."</p>

<p>"No," added Mrs. Tucker, shifting the
heavy baby to her other arm and hoping that
Aunty Jane would not notice the dust on the
battered table, "we couldn't even think of
sending Bettie. But Mrs. Slater intends letting
Henrietta go some place next fall; why
don't you talk it over with her?"</p>

<p>"I mean to," assured Aunty Jane. "You
see, it will need a great deal of talking over
because it may prove hard to find exactly the
right kind of school. The eastern seminaries
are too far away. It must be some place
south of Lakeville, within a day's journey,
within reach of all our pocketbooks, and in
a healthful location. It mustn't be too big,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
too stylish, or too old-fashioned. I'm sending
out postal cards every day and getting
catalogues by every mail; but so far, I
haven't come to any decision except that
Marjory is to go <i>some</i> place."</p>

<p>At first, the older people said little about
school matters to the four girls, but as winter
wore on it became an understood thing
that not only fortunate Henrietta but Jean,
Marjory and Mabel were to go away to
school the following September.</p>

<p>"Won't it be simply glorious," said Henrietta,
who was entertaining the Cottagers
in her den, "if all four of us land in the
same school; and we <i>must</i>&mdash;I shall stand out
for that. And you and I, Jean, shall room
together and be chums."</p>

<p>"Then Marjory and I," announced
Mabel, "shall room together, too, and fight
just the way we always do if Jean isn't on
hand to stop us."</p>

<p>"Won't it be perfectly fine?" breathed
Marjory. "I've always loved boarding-school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
stories and now we'll be living right
in one."</p>

<p>Bettie kept silence, but her eyes were big
and troubled. With the girls gone she
knew that her world would be sadly changed.
Her close companionship with the other Cottagers&mdash;she
was only three when she first
began to play with Jean&mdash;had prevented her
forming other friendships. Without doubt,
Aunty Jane would be lonely; the Bennetts, in
Germany, might miss noisy, affectionate
Mabel, Mrs. Mapes might long for helpful
Jean and Mrs. Slater would certainly find
her big, beautiful home dull with no sparkling
Henrietta but it was Bettie, poor little
impecunious, uncomplaining Bettie, who
would be the very loneliest of all. The
others would lose only one girl apiece; Bettie's
loss would be fourfold. Lovely Jean,
sprightly Marjory, jolly Mabel and attractive
Henrietta&mdash;how <i>could</i> she spare them all
at once! And the glorious times the absent
four would have together&mdash;how <i>could</i> Bettie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
miss all that? It seemed, to the little, overwhelmed
girl, too big a trouble to talk about.</p>

<p>For a long, long time the more fortunate
girls were too taken up with their own
prospects to think very seriously of Bettie's;
but one day Jean was suddenly astonished at
the depth of misery that she surprised in
Bettie's wistful, tell-tale eyes. After that,
the girls openly expressed their pity for Bettie,
who would have to stay in Lakeville.
This proved even harder to bear than their
light-hearted chatter; for it made Bettie pity
herself to an even greater extent.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be several months before
the hated school&mdash;Bettie, by this time,
was quite certain that she hated it&mdash;would
swallow up her dearest four friends at one
sudden, hideous gulp; but remote as the date
was, the interested girls could talk of very
little else. No matter what topic they might
begin with, it always worked around at last
to "when I go away next fall."</p>

<p>"I can't have any clothes this spring,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
said Jean, when the girls, in a body, were
escorting Henrietta home from her dressmaker's.
"Mother's letting my old things
down and piecing everything till I feel like
a walking bedquilt. You see, I'm to have
new things to go away with."</p>

<p>"Same here," asserted Mabel. "Only <i>my</i>
mother's having a worse time than yours to
make my things meet. My waist measure is
twenty-nine inches and my skirt bands are
only twenty-seven."</p>

<p>"<i>Only</i> twenty-seven," groaned shapely
Henrietta.</p>

<p>"If you see a second Aunty Jane," said
Marjory, skipping ahead to imitate the elder
Miss Vale's prim, peculiar walk, "running
round Lakeville all summer, you'll know
who it is. She's cutting down two of her
thousand-year-old gowns to tide me over the
season. One came out of the Ark and she
purchased the other at a little shop on Mount
Ararat."</p>

<p>"Grandmother's making lists," laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Henrietta, "of all the things mentioned in
all the catalogues. When she gets done,
probably she'll add them all up and divide
the result by <i>me</i>; and that will give a respectable
outfit for one girl."</p>

<p>"Poor Bettie!" said sympathetic Jean,
squeezing Bettie's slim hand. "You're out
of it all, aren't you?"</p>

<p>But this was too much for Bettie. She
turned hastily and fled.</p>

<p>The girls looked after her pityingly.</p>

<p>"Poor Bettie!" murmured Jean. "It's
awfully hard on her to hear all this talk
about school. She's always had us, you
know, and she thinks there won't be a scrap
of Lakeville left when we're gone."</p>

<p>In February Rosa Marie created a little
excitement by coming down with measles.
Maggie, the maid, had broken out with this
unlovely affliction and no one had suspected
what the trouble was until she had peeled in
the actual presence of Rosa Marie. Of
course Rosa Marie came down with measles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
too. But there was an unusual feature about
this illness. Although it was Maggie and
Rosa Marie who were supposed to be the
sufferers it was really Mrs. Crane who did
all the suffering. You see, this inexperienced
lady read all the literature that she
could find that touched on the subject of
measles and its after-effects; and long after
Rosa Marie had entirely recovered, conscientious
Mrs. Crane remained awake
nights waiting for the dreaded "after-effects"
to develop.</p>

<p>"We'll bury Mrs. Crane with whooping
cough," sputtered Dr. Bennett, writing a
soothing prescription for the good lady, "if
Rosa Marie ever catches it. She's a hen
bringing up a solitary duckling, and she's
certainly overdoing it. She ought not to
have the responsibility of that child; she's
not fitted for responsibilities, yet she's the
sort that takes 'em."</p>

<p>"I'll adopt Rosa Marie myself," declared
Henrietta Bedford, hearing of this opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and waylaying Dr. Bennett in Mrs. Slater's
hall to make her light-hearted offer. "She'd
go beautifully with the other picturesque objects
in my den and I'm very sure that the
responsibility won't weigh <i>me</i> down."</p>

<p>"So am I," laughed Dr. Bennett. "So
sure of it that I shan't allow you to afflict
your grandmother with any carelessly
adopted babies. But that child is on my
conscience, since Mabel was the principal
culprit in the matter. We'll try to get Mrs.
Crane to send her to an asylum; only that
dear lady's conscience will have to be bombarded
from all sides before it will let her
consent to any such sensible plan. Perhaps
you can get the girls&mdash;particularly Mabel,&mdash;to
look at the matter from that point of
view; we must rescue Mrs. Crane."</p>

<p>"I'll try to," promised Henrietta.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>Anxious Days</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>FOR the next few weeks the Cottagers led
as quiet a life as almost daily association
with Henrietta would permit. Jean
grew a trifle taller, Marjory discovered new
ways of doing her hair and Mabel remained
as round and ruddy as ever. But everybody
was worried about Bettie. She seemed
listless and indifferent in school, she fell
asleep over her books when she attempted to
study at night, she grew averse to getting
up mornings and day by day she grew thinner
and paler, until even heedless Mabel observed
that she was all eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" asked Jean, when
Bettie said that she didn't feel like going to
the Public Library corner to view the Uncle
Tom's Cabin parade. "A walk would do
you good, and it's only four blocks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm tired," returned Bettie. "My head
would like to go but my feet would rather
not. And my hands don't want to do anything&mdash;or
even my tongue. You can tell me
about the parade&mdash;that'll be easier than looking
at it."</p>

<p>Now, this was a new Bettie. The old one,
while not exactly a noisy person, had been so
active physically that the others had sometimes
found it difficult to follow her dancing
footsteps. She had ever been quick to wait
on the other members of her large family;
or to do errands, in the most obliging
fashion, for any of her friends. This new
Bettie eyed the Tucker cat sympathetically
when it mewed for milk; but she relegated
the task of feeding pussy to one of her much
more unwilling small brothers.</p>

<p>"She needs a tonic," said Mrs. Tucker,
giving Bettie dark-brown doses from a large
bottle. "It's the spring, I guess."</p>

<p>Two days after the parade there was great
excitement among Bettie's friends. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
had not appeared at school. That in itself
was not an unusual occurrence, for Bettie
often stayed at home to help her overburdened
mother through particularly trying
days; but when Jean stopped in to consult
her little friend about homemade valentines,
Mrs. Tucker met her with the news that
Bettie was sick in bed.</p>

<p>"Can't I see her?" asked Jean.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," replied Mrs. Tucker,
who looked worried. "She's asleep just
now and she has a temperature."</p>

<p>When Mabel heard this latter fact she at
once consulted Dr. Bennett.</p>

<p>"Father," she queried, "do folks ever die
of temperature?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," returned the Doctor. "If
the temperature is below zero they sometimes
freeze. Why?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tucker says that's what Bettie's
got&mdash;temperature."</p>

<p>"It isn't a disease, child. It's a condition
of heat or cold. But it's too soon to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
anything about Bettie&mdash;go play with your
dolls."</p>

<p>Henrietta and the remaining Cottagers
immediately thought of lovely things to do
for Bettie. So, too, did Mr. Black. Impulsive
Henrietta purchased a large box of
most attractive candy, Jean made her a
lovely sponge cake that sat down rather
sadly in the middle but rose nobly at both
ends; Mabel begged half a lemon pie from
the cook; Marjory concocted a wonderful
bowl of orange jelly with candied cherries on
top, Mrs. Crane made a steaming pitcherful
of chicken soup and Mr. Black sent in a
great basket of the finest fruit that the Lakeville
market afforded.</p>

<p>But when all these successive and well-meaning
visitors presented themselves and
their unstinted offerings at the Rectory door,
Dr. Tucker received them sadly.</p>

<p>"Bettie is down with a fever," said he.
"She can't eat <i>anything</i>."</p>

<p>The days that followed were the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
dreadful that the Cottagers had ever known.
They lived in suspense. Day after day
when they asked for news of Bettie the response
was usually, "Just about the same."
Occasionally, however, Dr. Bennett shook
his head dubiously and said, "Not quite so
well to-day."</p>

<p>For weeks&mdash;for <i>years</i> it seemed to the disheartened
children&mdash;these were the only tidings
that reached them from the sick-room.
There was a trained nurse whose white cap
sometimes gleamed in an upper window, the
grave-faced, uncommunicative doctor visited
the house twice a day, a boy with parcels from
the drug store could frequently be seen entering
the Rectory gate and that was about all
that the terribly interested friends could
learn concerning their beloved Bettie. They
spent most of their time hovering quietly
and forlornly about Mrs. Mapes's doorstep,
for that particular spot furnished the best
view of the afflicted Rectory. They wanted,
poor little souls, to keep as close to Bettie as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
possible. If the sun shone during this time,
they did not know it; for all the days seemed
dark and miserable.</p>

<p>"If we could only help a little," mourned
Jean, who looked pale and anxious, "it
wouldn't be so bad."</p>

<p>"I teased her," sighed Henrietta, repentantly,
"only two days before she was taken
sick. I do wish I hadn't."</p>

<p>"I gave her the smaller half of my
orange," lamented Mabel, "the very last
time I saw her. If&mdash;if I don't ever see&mdash;see
her again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," comforted Marjory, hastily,
"she might have been just that much sicker
if she'd eaten the larger piece. But <i>I</i> wish
I hadn't talked so much about boarding
school. It always worried her and sometimes
I tried [Marjory blushed guiltily at
the remembrance] to make her just a little
envious."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," confessed Jean, "I sometimes
neglected her just a little for Henrietta;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
but I mean to make up for it if&mdash;if I
have a chance."</p>

<p>"That's it," breathed Marjory, softly, "if
we only have a chance."</p>

<p>Then, because the March wind wailed forlornly,
because the waiting had been so long
and because it seemed to the discouraged
children as if the chance, after all, were extremely
slight&mdash;as slight and frail a thing as
poor little Bettie herself&mdash;the four friends
sat very quietly for many minutes on the
rail of the Mapes's broad porch, with big
tears flowing down their cheeks. Presently
Mabel fell to sobbing outright.</p>

<p>Mr. Black, on his way home from his
office, found them there. He had meant to
salute them in his usual friendly fashion, but
at sight of their disconsolate faces he merely
glanced at them inquiringly.</p>

<p>"She's&mdash;she's just about the same,"
sobbed Jean.</p>

<p>Mr. Black, without a word, proceeded on
his way; but all the sparkle had vanished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
from his dark eyes and his countenance
seemed older. He, too, was unhappy on Bettie's
account and he lived in hourly dread of
unfavorable news. The very next morning,
however, there was a more hopeful air about
Dr. Bennett when he left the Rectory.
Mabel, waiting at home, questioned him
mutely with her eyes.</p>

<p>"A very slight change for the better,"
said he, "but it is too soon for us to be sure
of anything. We're not out of the woods
yet."</p>

<p>Next came the tidings that Bettie was
really improving, though not at all rapidly;
yet it was something to know that she was
started on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>Perhaps the tedious days that followed
were the most trying days of all, however,
for the impatient children; because the
"road to recovery" in Bettie's case seemed
such a tremendously long road that her little
friends began to fear that Bettie would
never come into sight at the end of it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
she did at last. And such a forlorn Bettie
as she was!</p>

<p>She had certainly been very ill. They had
shaved her poor little head, her eyes seemed
almost twice their usual size and the girls
had not believed that any living person could
become so pitiably thin; but the wasting
fever was gone and what was left of Bettie
was still alive.</p>

<p>Long before the invalid was able to sit up,
the girls had been admitted one by one and
at different times, to take a look at her.
Bettie had smiled at them. She had even
made a feeble little joke about being able to
count every one of her two hundred bones.</p>

<p>After a time, Bettie could sit up in bed.
A few days later, rolled in a gaily flowered
quilt presented by the women of the parish;
she occupied a big, pillowed chair near the
window; and all four of the girls were able
to throw kisses to her from Jean's porch.
And now she could eat a few spoonfuls of
Mrs. Crane's savory broth, a very little of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Marjory's orange jelly and one or two of
Mr. Black's imported grapes. But, for a
long, long time, Bettie progressed no further
than the chair.</p>

<p>"I don't know what ails that child," confessed
puzzled Dr. Bennett. "She's like a
piece of elastic with all the stretch gone from
the rubber. She seems to lack something;
not exactly vitality&mdash;animation, perhaps, or
ambition. Yes, she certainly lacks ambition.
She ought to be outdoors by now."</p>

<p>"Hurry and get well," urged Jean, who
had been instructed to try to rouse her too-slowly-improving
friend. "The weather's
warmer every day and it won't be long before
we can open Dandelion Cottage. And
we've sworn a tremendous vow not to show
Henrietta&mdash;she's crazy to see it&mdash;a single
inch of that house until you're able to trot
over with us. Here's the key. You're to
keep it until you're ready to unlock that door
yourself."</p>

<p>"Drop it into that vase," directed Bettie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
"It seems a hundred miles to that cottage,
and I'll never have legs enough to walk so
far."</p>

<p>"Two are enough," encouraged Jean.</p>

<p>"Both of mine," mourned Bettie, displaying
a wrinkled stocking, "wouldn't make a
whole one."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Slater wants to take you to drive
every day, just as soon as you are able to
wear clothes. She told me to tell you."</p>

<p>"It seems a fearfully long way to the
stepping stone," sighed Bettie. "Go home,
please. It's makes me tired to <i>think</i> of
driving."</p>

<p>"There's certainly something amiss with
Bettie," said Dr. Bennett, when told of this
interview. "Some little spring in her seems
broken. We must find it and mend it or we
won't have any Bettie."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>An April Harvest</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>SPRING is an unknown season in Lakeville.
But if one waits sufficiently long,
there comes at last a period known as the
breaking of winter. Since, owing to the
heavy snows of January, February and
March, there is always a great deal of winter
to break, the process is an extended and&mdash;to
the "overshoed" young&mdash;a decidedly trying
one. But even in northerly Lakeville there
finally came an afternoon when the girls
decided that the day was much too fine to be
spent indoors; and that the hour had arrived
when it would be safe to leave off rubbers.
The snow had disappeared except in very
shaded spots and the Bay was free of ice
except for a line of white that showed far
out beyond the intense blue. The sidewalks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
were comparatively dry, but streams of icy
water gurgled merrily in the deep gutters
that ran down all the sloping streets. Although
this abundant moisture was only the
result of melting snow in the hills back of
Lakeville and possessed no beauty in itself,
these impetuous streams gave forth pleasant
springlike sounds and made one think sentimentally
of babbling brooks, fresh clover
and blossoms by the wayside. Yet one
needed to draw pretty heavily on one's imagination
to see either flowers or grass at
that early date; but the <i>feel</i> of them, as Jean
said, was certainly in the air.</p>

<p>"Let's walk down by Mrs. Malony's,"
suggested Mabel.</p>

<p>"She doesn't milk at this time of day,
does she?" queried Henrietta, cautiously.</p>

<p>"We needn't go in," assured Mabel.
"We'll just run down one hill and up the
other; but it's always lovely to walk along
the shore road. There's a sort of a side-walk&mdash;if
folks aren't too particular."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be beautiful," sighed Jean,
"if Bettie could only come too? This air
would do anybody good."</p>

<p>"Yes," mourned Marjory, "nothing
seems quite right without Bettie."</p>

<p>The girls, a trifle saddened, went slowly
down the hill.</p>

<p>"We must certainly steer clear of Mrs.
Malony," warned Henrietta, as the egg-woman's
house became visible. "Another
dose of her hot milk would drive me from
Lakeville."</p>

<p>"There she is now!" exclaimed Mabel.
"I recognize her by her cow; she's driving
it home."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it ran away to look for summer,"
offered Marjory. "The lady seems
displeased with her pet."</p>

<p>"An' how are the darlin' childer?" cried
Mrs. Malony, greeting her friends while yet
a long way off. "'Tis a sight for a quane
to see, so manny purty lasses. But where's
me little black-oiyed Bettie&mdash;there's the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
swate choild for yez? Sure Oi heard she
was loike to die, wan while back. Betther,
is ut? Thot's good, thot's good. An' wud
yez belave ut, Miss Mabel,&mdash;'tis fatter than
iver yez are, Oi see&mdash;Oi had yez in me moind
all this blissid day."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Mabel, rather coldly.</p>

<p>"Well, 'twas loike this, darlin'," explained
Mrs. Malony, dropping her voice to
a more confidential tone and nodding significantly
toward a distant chimney. "'Twas
siven o'clock the mornin' whin Oi seen
smoke risin' from the shanty beyant. All
day Oi've been moinded to be goin' acrost
the p'int an' lookin' in at thot windy to see
if 'twas thot big-eyed Frinch wan come back
wid the spring."</p>

<p>"You don't mean Rosa Marie's mother!"
gasped Mabel.</p>

<p>"Thot same," proceeded Mrs. Malony,
calmly. "But what wid Malony white-washin'
me kitchen, an' me pesky hins
walkin' in me parlor and me cow breakin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
down me fince, sure Oi've had no toime to be
traipsin' about."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you go now?" queried Jean,
eagerly. "If it <i>is</i> that woman we ought to
know it."</p>

<p>"Wait till Oi toi up me cow," consented
Mrs. Malony.</p>

<p>The four friends, with Mrs. Malony in
tow, picked their way over the badly kept
path that led to the shanty.</p>

<p>"The door's been mended," announced
observant Marjory.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem quite proper," said gentle-mannered
Jean, "to peek into people's
windows. Couldn't we knock and ask in a
perfectly proper way to see the lady of the
house?"</p>

<p>"Sure we could thot," replied Mrs.
Malony.</p>

<p>"Do hurry!" urged Mabel, breathlessly.</p>

<p>There was no response to Jean's rather
nervous knock; but when Mrs. Malony applied
her stout knuckles to the door there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
were results. The door was opened cautiously,
just a tiny crack at first, then to its
full extent. A dark-eyed woman with two
thick braids falling over her shapely shoulders
confronted them.</p>

<p>She swept a mildly curious glance over
Mrs. Malony, over Jean, over Marjory, over
Henrietta. Then her splendid eyes fell
upon Mabel; they changed instantaneously.</p>

<p>In a twinkling the woman had brushed
past the others to seize startled Mabel by
both shoulders and to gaze piercingly into
Mabel's frightened eyes. The woman tried
to speak; but, for a long moment, her voice
would not come.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you!" she gasped, clutching
Mabel still more tightly, as if she feared that
the youngster might escape. "Ees eet you
for sure? But w'ere, w'ere&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>No further words would come. The poor
creature's evident emotion was pitiful to
see, and the girls were too overwhelmed to
do more than stare with all their might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rosa Marie's all right," gulped Mabel,
coming to the rescue with exactly the right
words. "She's safe and happy."</p>

<p>"Ma babee, ma babee," moaned the
woman, her long-lashed eyes beaming with
wonderful tenderness, and expressive of intense
longing. "Bring me to heem queek&mdash;ah,
so queek as evaire you can. Ma babee&mdash;I
want heem queek."</p>

<p>Then, without stopping for outer garments
or even to close her door, and still
holding fast to the abductor of Rosa Marie,
the woman hurriedly led the way from the
clearing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Malony would have remained with
the party if she had not encountered her
frolicsome cow, a section of fence-rail dangling
from her neck, strolling off toward
town.</p>

<p>On the way up the long hill the woman,
who still possessed all the beauty and the
"mother-looks" that Mabel had described,
talked volubly in French, in Chippewa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Indian and in broken English. As Henrietta
was able to understand some of the
French and part of the English, the girls
were able to make out almost two-thirds of
what she was saying.</p>

<p>On the day of Mabel's first visit the young
mother had departed with her new husband,
who, not wanting to be burdened with a
step-child, had persuaded her to abandon
Rosa Marie, for whom she had subsequently
mourned without ceasing. As might have
been expected, the man had proved unkind.
He had beaten her, half starved her and
finally deserted her. She had worked all
winter for sufficient money to carry her to
Lakeville and had waited impatiently&mdash;all
that time without news of her baby&mdash;for
mild weather in order that the shanty, the
only home that she knew, might become
habitable.</p>

<p>The hill was steep and long, but all five
hastened toward the top. Marjory ran
ahead to ring the Black-Crane door-bell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Mabel piloted the trembling mother straight
to the nursery. Jean, learning from Martin
where to look for Mrs. Crane, ran to
fetch her.</p>

<p>Rosa Marie, in her little chair and placidly
stringing beads, looked up as unconcernedly
as if it were an ordinary occasion. The
woman, uttering broken, incoherent sounds
sped across the big room, dropped to her
knees and flung her arms about Rosa Marie.
Then, for many moments, her face buried in
Rosa Marie's neck, the only-half-civilized
mother sobbed unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>The child, however, gazed stolidly over
her mother's shoulder at the other visitors,
all of whom were much more moved than
she. Mrs. Crane, indeed, was shedding
tears and even Mr. Black seemed touched.
As for Mabel, that sympathetic young person
was weeping both visibly and audibly,
without exactly knowing why.</p>

<p>Since the repentant mother, who refused
to let her baby out of her arms for a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
moment, begged to be allowed to take Rosa
Marie to the shanty that very night, Mrs.
Crane, aided by the willing girls and Mr.
Black, did what they could toward making
the place comfortable.</p>

<p>After Martin and Mr. Black had carried
a whole motor-carful of bedding, food and
fuel to the shanty, the now radiant mother,
Rosa Marie, her toys, her clothes and all her
belongings, were likewise transported to
the humble lakeside dwelling. Everybody
was so busy and the whole affair was
over so quickly that no one had time for
regrets.</p>

<p>"I declare," said Mrs. Crane, wonderingly,
"I ought to feel as if I'd lost something.
Instead, I'm all of a whirl."</p>

<p>"I said," Mabel triumphed, "that she'd
come back."</p>

<p>Jean was commissioned to go the next
morning to break the news to Bettie. It
seemed to Dr. Bennett and to the hopeful
Cottagers that this important happening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
would surely rouse the listless little maid if
anything could. Mr. Black, who arrived
with a great bunch of violets while Jean was
telling the wonderful tale as graphically as
she could, expectantly watched Bettie's pale
countenance. Her wistful, weary eyes
brightened for a moment and a faint, tender
smile flickered across her lips.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," said she. "Now Mrs.
Crane won't have to have whooping cough
and all the other things."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Crane is going to find work for
Rosa Marie's mother," announced Jean,
"and the shanty is to be mended."</p>

<p>"That's nice," returned Bettie, who, however,
no longer seemed interested in Rosa
Marie's mother. "But my ears are tired
now; don't tell me any more."</p>

<p>After this failure, Mr. Black followed
crestfallen Jean downstairs; he drew her into
the shabby Rectory parlor.</p>

<p>"Now, Jean," demanded he, sternly, "is
there a solitary thing in this whole world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
that Bettie wants? Is there anything that
could <i>possibly</i> happen that would wake her
up and bring her back? I'm dreadfully
afraid she's slipping away from us, Jean;
and she's far too precious to lose. Now
think&mdash;think <i>hard</i>, little girl. Has she <i>ever</i>
wanted anything?"</p>

<p>"Why," responded Jean, slowly, as if
some outside force were dragging the words
from her, "right after Christmas there <i>was</i>
something, I think. A big, impossible something
that <i>nobody</i> could possibly help. She
didn't talk about it&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash; Perhaps
she did worry."</p>

<p>"Go on," insisted Mr. Black, "I want it
all."</p>

<p>"She seemed to get used to the idea so&mdash;so
uncomplainingly. Still, she may have
cared more than anybody suspected. She's
<i>like</i> that&mdash;never cries when she's hurt."</p>

<p>"What idea?" demanded Mr. Black.
"Cared for what? Make it clear,
child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see," explained Jean, "all of us&mdash;Henrietta,
Marjory, Mabel and I&mdash;have
been talking a great deal about going away
to boarding school&mdash;we're all going. But
Bettie&mdash;Bettie, of course, knew that she
couldn't go. There was no money and her
father said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And why in thunder," shouted Mr.
Black, forgetting the invalid and striding up
and down the room with his fists clenched,
"didn't somebody say so? What do folks
think the good Lord <i>gave</i> us money for?
Why didn't&mdash;Come upstairs. We'll settle
this thing right now."</p>

<p>Impulsive Mr. Black, with dazed Jean at
his heels, opened Bettie's door and walked in.
Bettie lifted her tired eyes in very mild
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Bad pennies," she smiled, "always come
back. What's all the noise about?"</p>

<p>"Bettie," demanded Mr. Black, "do you
want to go away to school with those
other girls next September?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Bettie opened her eyes wide. Jean said
afterwards that she "pricked up her ears,"
too.</p>

<p>"Because," continued Mr. Black, keeping
a sharp watch on Bettie's awakening countenance,
"you're going. And if <i>I</i> say
you're going, you surely are. Now, don't
worry about it&mdash;the thing's settled. You're
going with the others."</p>

<p>"Open the windows," pleaded Bettie, her
face alight with some of the old-time eagerness.
"I want to see how it smells outdoors."</p>

<p>"I believe we've done it," breathed
Jean. "She looks a lot brighter."</p>

<p>And they had. No one had realized how
tender, uncomplaining Bettie had dreaded
losing her friends. And in her weakened
state, both before and after the fever, the
trouble had seemed very big. The load had
almost crushed sick little Bettie. Now that
it was lifted, and it was, for Mr. Black
swept everything before him, there was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to keep the little girl from getting well
with truly gratifying speed.</p>

<p>"Bettie," asked Dr. Bennett, the next
evening, "are you sure this is your own
pulse? If it is, it's behaving properly at last."</p>

<p>"She ate every bit of her supper," said
Mrs. Tucker, happily, "and she asked, this
afternoon, if she owned any shoes. She's
really getting well."</p>

<p>"I'm hurrying," laughed happy Bettie,
"to make up for lost time. Do give me
things to make me fat&mdash;as fat as Mabel."</p>

<p>"She's certainly better," said the satisfied
doctor. "By to-morrow we'll have to tie
her down to keep her from dancing. She's
our own Bettie, at last."</p>
